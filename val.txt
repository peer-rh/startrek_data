pilot
 [Bridge]
SPOCK: Check the circuit. 
TYLER: All operating, sir. 
SPOCK: It can't be the screen then. Definitely something out there,
Captain, headed this way. 
TYLER: It could be these meteorites. 
ONE: No, it's something else. There's still something out there. 
TYLER: It's coming at the speed of light, collision course. The
meteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain.
ONE: Evasive manoeuvres, sir?
PIKE: Steady as we go.
GARISON: It's a radio wave, sir. We're passing through an old-style
distress signal.
PIKE: They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this
way.
GARISON: A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir. That's it. No
other message.
TYLER: I have a fix. It comes from the Talos star group.
ONE: We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.
SPOCK: Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia.
It disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
TYLER: It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to
here.
SPOCK: Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar
system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class
M, oxygen atmosphere.
ONE: Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years.
PIKE: If they survived the crash.
SPOCK: We aren't going to go, to be certain?
PIKE: Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega
Colony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the
helm. Maintain present course.
ONE: Yes, sir.
[Pike's quarters]
BOYCE [OC}: Boyce here.
PIKE: Drop by my cabin, Doctor. (Boyce enters with bag) What's that? I
didn't say there's anything wrong with me.
BOYCE: I understand we picked up a distress signal.
PIKE: That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it
seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to
log the ship's doctor's opinion, too.
BOYCE: Oh, I concur with yours, definitely.
PIKE: Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the
Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also.
What the devil are you putting in there, ice?
BOYCE: Who wants a warm martini?
PIKE: What makes you think I need one?
BOYCE: Sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell
his doctor. What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel Seven?
PIKE: Shouldn't it be? My only yeoman and two others dead, seven
injured.
BOYCE: Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?
PIKE: Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the
armour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted
fortress and attacked by one of their warriors.
BOYCE: Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You
treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now
you're tired and you
PIKE: You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for
two hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too
risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who
doesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil.
BOYCE: To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?
PIKE: To the point of considering resigning.
BOYCE: And do what?
PIKE: Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles
of parkland around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we
used to take some food and ride out all day.
BOYCE: Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day.
PIKE: I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on
Regulus or on the Orion colony.
BOYCE: You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?
PIKE: The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole
galaxy of things to choose from.
BOYCE: Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets
it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to
wither away.
PIKE: Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender.
BOYCE: Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers.
The living and the dying.
SPOCK [on monitor]: Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up
message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos.
[Bridge]
GARISON: (reads) Eleven survivors from crash.
Gravity and oxygen within limits. Food and water obtainable, but
unless. The message faded at that point, sir.
PIKE: Address intercraft.
TYLER: System open.
PIKE: This is the captain. Our destination is the Talos star group. Our
time warp, factor seven.
TYLER: Course computed and on the screen.
ONE: All decks have acknowledged, sir.
PIKE : Engage.
TYLER: On course, sir. 
(Colt enters. Pike turns around and bumps into her) 
PIKE: Yeoman. 
COLT: Yes, sir. 
PIKE: I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge 
COLT: But you wanted the reports by oh five hundred. It's oh five
hundred now, sir. 
PIKE: Oh, I see. Thank you. 
ONE: She's replacing your former yeoman, sir. 
PIKE: She does a good job, all right. It's just that I can't get used
to having a woman on the bridge. No offence, Lieutenant. You're
different, of course. 
(The Enterprise arrives at a planet) 
TYLER: We've settled into orbit, sir.
GEOLOGIST: Geological lab report complete, Captain.
SPOCK: Preliminary lab survey ready, sir.
PIKE: Spectography?
GEOLOGIST: Our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, sir, heavy
with inert elements but well within safety limits.
PIKE: Gravity?
GEOLOGIST: Zero point nine of Earth.
TYLER: Captain? Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface. As I read
it, they polarise out as rounded metal bits. Could be parts of a
spaceship hull.
PIKE: Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it?
SPOCK: Yes, sir.
TYLER: Yes, sir. 
PIKE: Sorry, Number One. With little information on this planet, we'll
have to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us.
ONE: Of course, sir.
[Transporter room]
PIKE: There's no indication of problems down there,
but let's not take chances.
PITCAIRN: Yes, sir. There's a canyon to the left. We can set you there
completely unobserved.
[Planet surface]
(the group explores until they find a rough
settlement) 
GARISON: Sir.
OLD MAN: They're men. They're humans.
PIKE: Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise.
HASKINS: Doctor Theodore Haskins, American Continent lnstitute.
SURVIVOR: Is Earth all right?
PIKE: The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon.
TYLER: And you won't believe how fast you can get back. Well the time
barrier's been broken. Our new ships can
(He's struck dumb by the sight of a lovely young woman) 
HASKINS: This is Vina. Her parents are dead. She was born almost as we
crashed.
(The reunion is being watched on another screen, by three people with
big bald heads) 
PIKE: (as the survivors pack up the settlement) Enterprise.
ONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.
PIKE: We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to
you very shortly.
ONE [OC]: Quarters are being prepared, sir. Have I permission to send
out scouting and scientific parties now?
PIKE: That's affirmative on the
VINA: You appear to be healthy and intelligent, Captain. A prime
specimen.
ONE [OC]: I didn't get that last message, Captain.
PIKE: Er, affirmative on request. Landing party out.
HASKINS: You must forgive her choice of words, Captain. She's lived her
whole life with a collection of aging scientists.
BOYCE: If they can spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical
report.
VINA: I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.
BOYCE: Their health is excellent. Almost too good.
HASKINS: There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt
if Earth is ready to learn the secret. Let the girl show you. We'll
accept your judgment.
(Pike follows Vina up a slope to a ledge by a rock face) 
VINA: You're tired, but don't worry. You'll feel much better soon.
Don't you see it? Here and here.
PIKE: I don't understand.
VINA: You will. You're a perfect choice. 
(Vina vanishes, and so do all the survivors and their encampment. A
door opens in the rock face, Pike is knocked out and taken inside. At
the settlement -)
TYLER: Captain! 
(Everyone rushes over in time to see the door closing in the rock. They
fire their phasers at it but it just blasts away the rock covering to
show the metal underneath.) 
SPOCK: Spock here.
ONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.
SPOCK: There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some
sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?
[Pike's cage]
(Pike wakes to find himself in a cell with a
transparent wall blocking his escape. He tests it's strength, and
notices other similar occupied cells. There's a fanged ape, a giant
bird and other scary shadows. The three aliens arrive)
PIKE: Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the
space vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this
galaxy. Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me?
(the aliens communicate with their minds, not voices)
TALOSIAN: It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen
is shockingly limited.
MAGISTRATE: This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so
easily with a simulated message. As you can read in its thoughts, it is
only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a
simple illusion we placed in their minds.
PIKE: You're not speaking, yet I can hear you.
MAGISTRATE: You will note the confusion as it reads our thought
transmissions.
PIKE: All right then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read
yours. Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an
unfriendly act
MAGISTRATE: You now see the primitive fear threat reaction. The
specimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel,
and so on. Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess,
the creature will throw himself against the transparency.
PIKE: If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these
walls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it.
MAGISTRATE: Despite its frustration, the creature appears more
adaptable than our specimens from other planets. We can soon begin the
experiment. 
[Briefing room]
SPOCK: The inhabitants of this planet must live
deep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down
there. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more
vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.
ONE: So we just thought we saw survivors there, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's
inhabitants.
BOYCE: It was a perfect illusion. They had us seeing just what we
wanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery,
everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp,
the tattered clothing, everything. Now let's be sure we understand the
danger of this. The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds. They
can create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and
experiences, even out of a person's own desires. Illusions just as real
and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore.
ONE: Any estimate what they might want one of us for? 
SPOCK: They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth
people are put together. Or it could be something more. 
TYLER: Then why aren't we doing anything? That entry may have stood up
against hand lasers, but we can transmit the ship's power against it.
Enough to blast half a continent. 
SPOCK: Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing
about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great
they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly.
TYLER: It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help, and he probably
needs it fast. ONE: Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power.
We'll try blasting through that metal.
[Talosian monitoring room]
(As Pike continues to explore his cell) 
TALOSIAN: Thousands of us are already probing the creature's thoughts,
Magistrate. We find excellent memory capacity.
MAGISTRATE: I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it
fought to protect its life. We will begin with this, giving the
specimen something more interesting to protect.
[Rigel Seven]
VINA: Come on, we must hide ourselves. Come, come.
Hurry. It's deserted. There'll be weapons and perhaps food.
PIKE: This is Rigel Seven.
VINA: Please, we must hide ourselves.
PIKE: I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo. I must still be
there.
VINA: Come on.
PIKE: They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere
I've been.
VINA: The killer!
PIKE: It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago. Except for you.
[Fortress]
(The courtyard is scattered with lances and spears)
PIKE: Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one the
survivors called Vina. Or rather the image of Vina. But why you again?
Why didn't they create a different girl? 
(The killer enters - a big humanoid with shield and axe) 
VINA: Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.
PIKE: But it's only a dream.
VINA: You have to kill him as you did here before.
PIKE: You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an
animal performing for its supper.
VINA: It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it. That's what
matters. You'll feel every moment of whatever happens to you. Please,
don't you know what he'll do to us? 
(so Pike fights the killer with mace and shield) 
PIKE: Why would an illusion be frightened? 
VINA: Because that's the way you imagined me. 
PIKE: Who are you? You act as if this were really you. 
VINA: Careful. 
(Pike and Vina retreat up some stairs. The killer breaks Pike's spear
and they throw objects at it. Pike gets knocked down into the
courtyard. The killer grabs Vina and Pike throws a spear into it's
back. Then it jumps down and spears itself on a wicked harpoon that
Pike grabs just in time)
[Pike's cell]
VINA: It's over. 
(Vina hugs her hero, then sees the Talosians watching them. The
Talosians leave.)
PIKE: Why are you here? 
VINA: To please you. 
PIKE: Are you real? 
VINA: As real as you wish. 
PIKE: No, no. No, that's not an answer. I've never met you before,
never even imagined you.
VINA: Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.
PIKE: What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear?
VINA: I have to wear something, don't I? I can wear whatever you wish,
be anything you wish.
PIKE: So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how
I react, is that it?
VINA: Don't you have a dream, something you've always wanted very badly?
PIKE: Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too?
VINA: You can have whatever dream you want. I can become anything, any
woman you've ever imagined. You can have anything you want in the whole
universe. Let me please you.
PIKE: Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there
any way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts
against me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way?
VINA: You're a fool.
PIKE: Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this
conversation, is there.
[Planet surface]
(A big laser cannon is aimed at the door in the
rock.
ONE: All circuits engaged, Mister Spock.
SPOCK [OC]: Standing by, Number One.
ONE: Take cover.
SPOCK [OC]: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
(The laser cannon blasts away)
ONE: Increase to full power! Can you give us any more?
SPOCK [OC]: Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease
power.
ONE: Disengage. The top of that knoll should have been sheared off the
first second.
BOYCE: Maybe it was. It's what I tried to explain in the briefing room.
Their power of illusion is so great, we can't be sure of anything we
do, anything we see.
[Pike's cell]
VINA: Perhaps if you asked me some questions, I
could answer.
PIKE: How far can they control my mind?
VINA: If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let
me live it with you?
PIKE: Perhaps.
VINA: They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do.
PIKE: But they try to trick me with their illusions.
VINA: And, they can punish you when you're not co-operative. You'll
find out about that. 
PIKE: Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go
underground?
VINA: War, thousands of centuries ago.
PIKE: That's why it's so barren up there?
VINA; The planet's only now becoming able to support life again.
PIKE: So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and
they concentrated on developing their mental power.
VINA: But they found it's a trap. Like a narcotic. Because when dreams
become more important than reality, you give up travel, building,
creating. You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by
your ancestors. You just sit, living and reliving other lives left
behind in the thought record.
PIKE: Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.
VINA: You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion
for you, they watch you react, feel your emotions. They have a whole
collection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from
all over this part of the galaxy.
PIKE: Which means they had to have more than one of each animal.
VINA: Please.
PIKE: They'll need a pair of humans too. Where do they get intend to
get the Earth woman?
VINA: You said that if I answered questions
PIKE: But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist. You said
you weren't real, remember?
VINA: I'm a woman as real and as human as you are. We're like Adam and
Eve. If we. Don't. Please don't punish me! (disappears)
(Pike sees the Magistrate walk away) 
(Pike continues to search the walls for a door when a hatch opens and a
glass is placed on the floor)
MAGISTRATE: The vial contains a nourishing protein complex.
PIKE: Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?
MAGISTRATE: If the form and the colour is not appealing, it can appear
as any food you wish to visualise.
PIKE: And if I prefer
MAGISTRATE: To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of
punishment.
(Pike is surrounded by fire and brimstone, screaming in pain)
MAGISTRATE: From a fable you once heard in childhood. You will now
consume the nourishment.
PIKE: Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you
can't, can you? You do have limitations, don't you?
MAGISTRATE: If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there
are things even more unpleasant.
(Pike drinks the nourishment then launches himself at the glass wall.
The Magistrate steps back in surprise)
PIKE: That's very interesting.
MAGISTRATE: Now to the female.
PIKE: You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then?
MAGISTRATE: As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our
planet, but with only a single survivor.
PIKE: No, let's stay on the first subject. All I wanted for that moment
was to get my hands around your neck.
MAGISTRATE: We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species
interesting.
PIKE: Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through?
MAGISTRATE: It became necessary to attract a mate.
PIKE: All right, all right, let's talk about the girl. You seem to be
going out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel
protective.
MAGISTRATE: This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species.
PIKE: It seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and
like her.
MAGISTRATE: We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life.
PIKE: Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her? So
I'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship? That would be necessary
only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human
community.
MAGISTRATE: With the female now properly conditioned.
PIKE: You mean properly punished! I'm the one who's not co-operating!
Why don't you punish me?
MAGISTRATE: First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy.
Excellent.
[Woodland glade]
(A picnic spread on a tartan rug, two horses
standing by, a futuristic city in the distance) 
VINA: You want some coffee, dear? I left the thermos hooked to my
saddle.
PIKE: Tango! You old devil, you. I'm sorry I don't have any sugar.
Well, they think of everything, don't they? (feeds lumps to the horse) 
VINA: Hey, your coffee. Is it good to be home?
PIKE: They read our minds very well. Home, anything else I want, if I
co-operate, is that it?
VINA: Have you forgotten my headaches, darling? I get them when you
talk strangely like this. 
PIKE: Look, I'm sorry they punish you, but we can't let them 
VINA: My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it? 
PIKE: It's funny. It's about twenty four hours ago I was telling the
ship's doctor how much I wanted something else not very different from
what we have here. An escape from reality. Life with no frustrations.
No responsibilities. Now that I have it, I understand the doctor's
answer. 
VINA: I hope you're hungry. These little white sandwiches are your
mother's recipe
for chicken tuna. 
PIKE: You either live life, bruises, skinned knees and all, or you turn
your back on it and start dying. The doctor's going to be happy about
one part, at least. He said I needed a rest. 
VINA: This is a lovely place to rest. 
PIKE: I used to ride through here when I was a kid. It's not as pretty
as some of the parkland around the big cities, but. That's Mojave.
That's where I was born. 
VINA: Is that supposed to be news to your wife? You're home. You can
even stay if you want. Wouldn't it be nice showing your children where
you once played? 
PIKE: These headaches, they'll be hereditary you know. Would you wish
them on a child or a whole group of children? 
VINA: Foolish. 
PIKE: Is it? Look, first they made me protect you and then feel
sympathy for you. Now we have these familiar surroundings and a
comfortable husband-wife relationship. They don't need all this for
just passion. What they're after is respect and mutual dependence. 
VINA: They say in the olden days all this was a desert. Blowing sand
and cactus. 
PIKE: But we're not here, neither of us. We're in a menagerie, a cage!
VINA: No.
PIKE; I can't help either one of us if you won't give me a chance. Now,
you told me once they used illusions as a narcotic. They couldn't
repair the machines left by their ancestors. Is that why they want us,
to build a colony of slaves?
VINA: Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us?
PIKE: Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our
keeper couldn't read my thoughts. Do emotions like hate, keeping hate
in your mind, does that block off our mind from them?
VINA: Yes. They can't read through primitive emotions. But you can't
keep it up for long enough. I've tried. They keep at you and at you
year after year, tricking and punishing, and they won. They own me. I
know you must hate me for that.
PIKE: Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like.
VINA: But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my
feelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man. That's why they
picked you. I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the
same way.
PIKE: If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you. 
[Talosian monitoring room]
PIKE [on monitor]: I was from the very first moment
I saw you in the survivor's camp. 
TALOSIAN: A curious species. They have fantasies they hide even from
themselves. 
VINA [on monitor]: I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for
you. You've been home, and fighting as on Rigel. That's not new to you,
either. A person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do. Yes, a
ship's captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and
proper. You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that.
[Open air party]
(A band plays, and a green woman dances sensuously)
OFFICER: Nice place you have here, Mister Pike.
(The dancer is -) 
PIKE: Vina?
ORION: Glistening green. Almost like secret dreams a bored ship captain
might have. 
OFFICER: Funny how they are on this planet. They actually like being
taken advantage of. Suppose you had all of space to choose from, and
this was only one small sample. 
ORION: Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul?
(Pike gets up and leaves. The door he walks through turns into a rock
wall. Then Vina is there, holding a blazing torch)
[Transporter room]
SPOCK: We've located a magnetic field that seems to
come from their underground generator.
GARISON: Could that be an illusion too? 
ONE: Now, you all know the situation. We're hoping to transport down
inside the Talosian community.
SPOCK: If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could
find oneself materialised inside solid rock.
ONE: Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out.
(Pitcairn energises but only Number One and Yeoman Colt dematerialise) 
SPOCK: The women!
[Pike's cage]
ONE: Captain! Captain.
VINA: No! Let me finish!
ONE: But we were a party of six.
COLT: We were the only ones transported.
VINA: It's not fair. You don't need them.
PIKE: (grabbing Colt's laser pistol) They don't work.
ONE: They were fully charged when we left. It's dead. (communicator) I
can't make a signal. What is it?
PIKE: Don't say anything. I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating
their huge, misshapen heads to pulp, thoughts so primitive they black
out everything else. I'm filling my mind with hate.
VINA: How long can you block your thoughts? A few minutes, an hour? How
can that help?
COLT: Leave him alone.
VINA: He doesn't need you. He's already picked me.
COLT: Picked her? For what? I don't understand.
VINA: Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring.
COLT: Offspring, as in children?
ONE: Offspring as in he's Adam. Is that it?
VINA: You're no better choice. They'd have more luck crossing him with
a computer.
ONE: Well, shall we do a little time computation? There was a Vina
listed on that expedition as an adult crewman. Now, adding eighteen
years to your age then.
(The Magistrate approaches the cell)
VINA: It's not fair. I did what you asked.
MAGISTRATE: Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a
selection.
PIKE: I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you. Is your blood
red like ours? I'm going to find out.
MAGISTRATE: Each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour.
The female you call Number One has the superior mind and would produce
highly intelligent children. Although she seems to lack emotion, this
is largely a pretence. She has often has fantasies involving you. 
PIKE: All I want to do is get my hands on you. Can you read these
thoughts? Images of hate, killing?
MAGISTRATE: The other new arrival has considered you unreachable but
now is realising this has changed. The factors in her favour are youth
and strength, plus unusually strong female drives. 
PIKE: You'll find my thoughts more interesting. Thoughts so primitive
you can't understand. Emotions so ugly
(stricken by pain)
MAGISTRATE: Wrong thinking is punishable. Right thinking will be as
quickly rewarded. You will find it an effective combination. 
(Magistrate leaves)
ONE: Captain.
PIKE: No. No, don't help me. I have to concentrate. They can't read
through hate.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Address intercraft. 
GARISON: Open, sir. 
SPOCK: This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but
to consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew.
We're leaving. All decks prepare for hyperdrive. Time warp factor. 
TYLER: Mister Spock, the ship's controls have gone dead. 
(The lights go out) 
SPOCK: Engine room! 
GARISON: Open. 
SPOCK: Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out. 
PITCAIRN [OC]: All systems are out, bridge. We've got nothing. 
TYLER: There's nothing. Every system aboard is fading out.
[Pike's cell]
 (The group are apparently dozing when the
Magistrate opens the hatch to get the laser pistols Pike dropped there.
He grabs him and pulls him into the cage, and starts to throttle him)
PIKE: Now you hold still, or I'll break your neck.
VINA: Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil.
PIKE: I've had some samples of how good they are.
(the Talosian appears to be a vicious monster)
PIKE: You stop this illusion, or I'll twist your head off. (it stops)
All right, now you try one more illusion, you try anything at all, and
I'll break your neck.
MAGISTRATE: Your ship. Release me or we'll destroy it.
{Bridge]
(The senior officers have taken the navigation
console apart) 
SPOCK: Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen.
TYLER: The computers! 
(The monitor shows a montage of images - space capsules, the Moon, maps
of Earth) 
TYLER: I can't shut it off. It's running through our library. Tapes,
micro-records, everything. It doesn't make sense. 
SPOCK: Could be we've waited too long. It's collecting all the
information stored in this fly. They've decided to swat us. 
[Pike's cell]
VINA: He's not bluffing, Captain. With illusion
they can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it
takes to destroy your ship.
PIKE: I'm going to gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason
at all. 
(Pike hands the Magistrate over to Number One and picks up the laser
pistols, firing them at the glass wall. Then he puts one to the
Magistrate's head) 
PIKE: On the other hand, I've got a reason. I'm willing to bet you've
created an illusion this laser is empty. I think it just blasted a hole
in that window and you're keep us from seeing it. You want me to test
my theory out on your head?
(There is a hole in the window) 
COLT: Captain. 
(They all leave through the hole and get into the elevator to the
surface)
[Planet surface]
(The top of the rocky knoll is split apart) 
PIKE: Make contact, Number One.
ONE: They kept us from seeing this, too. We cut through and never knew
it. Captain.
(The communicator isn't working) 
MAGISTRATE: As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing.
PIKE: I want to contact our ship.
MAGISTRATE: You are now on the surface where we wished you to be. With
the female of your choice, you will now begin carefully guided lives.
PIKE: And start by burying you?
MAGISTRATE: That is your choice. To help you reclaim the planet's
surface, our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life.
PIKE: Look, I'll make a deal with you. You and your life for the lives
of these two Earth women. 
MAGISTRATE: Since our lifespan is many times yours, we have time to
evolve you into a society trained to serve as artisans, technicians 
PIKE: Do you understand what I'm saying? You give me proof that our
ship is all right, send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina.
(Number One sets her laser pistol to overload)
ONE: It's wrong to create a whole race of humans to live as slaves.
MAGISTRATE: Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves?
VINA: What is that?
PIKE: The weapon is building up an overload. A force chamber explosion.
You still have time to get underground. Well, go on! (pushes Vina away)
Just to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her.
VINA: If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go either.
I suppose if they have one human being, they might try again. 
(More Talosians arrive) 
PIKE: Wait.
(Number One turns off the pistol) 
TALOSIAN: Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much
time. Are you prepared to assimilate it?
(The Magistrate nods, and the veins on his head throb) 
MAGISTRATE: We had not believed this possible. The customs and history
of your race show a unique hatred of captivity. Even when it's pleasant
and benevolent, you prefer death. This makes you too violent and
dangerous a species for our needs.
VINA: He means that they can't use you. You're free to go back to the
ship.
PIKE: And that's it? No apologies? You captured one of us, threatened
all of us.
TALOSIAN: Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to
eventual death. Is this not sufficient?
MAGISTRATE: No other specimen has shown your adaptability. You were our
last hope.
PIKE: But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual co-operation? 
MAGISTRATE: Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy
itself too.
ONE: Captain, we have transporter control now.
PIKE: Let's get back to the ship.
VINA: I can't. I can't go with you.
[Transporter room]
PITCAIRN: Sir, it just came on. We can't shut the
power off.
SPOCK: Mister Spock here.
TYLER [OC]: All power has come on, Mister Spock. The helm is answering
to control.
(The transporter platforms light up and first Colt, then Number One are
beamed aboard)
GARISON: The captain?
[Planet surface]
(Vina changes into a scarred, misshapen older woman)
VINA: You see why I can't go with you.
MAGISTRATE: This is the female's true appearance.
VINA: They found me in the wreckage, dying. A lump of flesh. They
rebuilt me. Everything works. But they had never seen a human. They had
no guide for putting me back together.
MAGISTRATE: It was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an
honest one.
PIKE: You'll give her back her illusion of beauty? 
MAGISTRATE: And more. 
(Beautiful Vina and happy Pike go up the slope and into the elevator) 
MAGISTRATE: She has an illusion and you have reality. May you find your
way as pleasant. 
[Transporter room]
PITCAIRN: Mister Spock, the system is coming on
again. 
(Pike is beamed aboard) 
COLT: What's happened to Vina? 
ONE: Isn't she coming with us?
PIKE: No. No, and I agreed with her reasons.
[Bridge]
(Pike, Number One and Spock enter) 
BOYCE: Hold on a minute. 
PIKE: Oh, I feel fine, just fine. 
BOYCE: You look a hundred percent better. 
PIKE: You recommended a rest, a change of pace, didn't you? I've even
been home. Does that make you happy? 
(He bumps into Colt again) 
PIKE: Yeoman. 
COLT: Yes, sir. 
PIKE: I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge I 
(She hands him a clip-board stuffed with papers for his signature) 
PIKE: Oh. Oh yes. The reports. Thank you. 
COLT: Sir, I was wondering. Just curious. Who would have been Eve? 
ONE: Yeoman! You've delivered your report. 
COLT: Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir. 
TYLER: Eve, sir? Yes, sir. 
BOYCE: Eve as in Adam? 
PIKE: As in all ship's doctors are dirty old men. What are we running
here, a cadet ship, Number One? Are we ready or not? 
ONE: All decks show ready, sir. 
PIKE: Engage.

Stardate:
1513.1 
Original Airdate: 8 Sep, 1966
  Captain's log, Stardate
1513.1. Our position, orbiting planet M-113. On board the Enterprise,
Mister Spock temporarily in command. On the planet the ruins of an
ancient and long-dead civilisation. Ship's surgeon McCoy and myself are
now beaming down to the planet's surface. Our mission, routine medical
examination of archaeologist Robert Crater and his wife Nancy.
Routine but for the fact that Nancy Crater is that one woman in Doctor
McCoy's past.
[Planet
surface outside building]
KIRK: Shall we pick some flowers, Doctor? When a man visits an old
girlfriend she usually expects something like that. 
MCCOY: Is that how you get girls to like you, by bribing them? There
doesn't seem to be anybody around, does there. 
KIRK: They'll be along. You rushed us down ten minutes early. (enter
building)
[Crater's
home]
KIRK: Professor Crater? Professor? Mrs. Crater? Nervous, Dr. McCoy? 
MCCOY: Yeah, a little bit, I guess. You see, we walked out of each
other's lives ten years ago. She married Crater, and for all I know she
may have forgotten me completely. Of all the bonehead ideas, Jim, how'd
I let myself in for things like this? 
NANCY: (singing outside, then enters) Leonard! 
MCCOY: Nancy. 
NANCY: Hello. 
MCCOY: It's good to see you.
NANCY: Let me look at you. 
MCCOY: You haven't aged a day. Oh, this is Captain Jim Kirk of the
Enterprise. 
KIRK: (seeing an older woman than McCoy does) Mrs. Crater. I've heard a
great deal about you. 
NANCY: All good, I hope. 
MCCOY: And Crewman Darnell. 
DARNELL: (seeing a young blonde) How do you do, ma'am? 
KIRK: Something wrong, Darnell? 
DARNELL: Excuse me sir but, ma'am, if I didn't know better I would
swear you were someone I left behind on Wrigley's Pleasure Planet. It's
funny, you're exactly like a girl that 
MCCOY: A little less mouth, Darnell. 
DARNELL: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I mean, I know it's impossible,
of course. 
KIRK: Why don't you step outside, Darnell. 
DARNELL: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
KIRK: Maybe I'll step outside, too. 
NANCY: What? And let Plum examine me all alone? 
KIRK: Plum? 
MCCOY: Plum. 
NANCY: A nickname I gave Leonard when we were very young. 
MCCOY: I'll, er, I'll wait for the professor and I'll catch you both at
once. 
NANCY: I'd better go get Bob. Every time he starts digging he forgets
time, sleep, food, everything. Be back in a minute.
[Planet
surface outside building]
BLONDE NANCY: It's quite warm here, isn't it? (encourages Darnell to
follow her)
Captain's log, additional entry. Since our mission was routine, we had
beamed down to the planet without suspicion. We were unaware each
member of the landing party was seeing a different woman, a different
Nancy Crater.
[Crater's
home]
KIRK: Professor Crater, I'm Captain Kirk. This is 
CRATER: The heroic Captain and the intrepid doctor cross interstellar
space to preserve our health. Your sense of duty is overwhelming. Now
will you please go back where you came from and tell whoever issues
your orders to leave me and my wife alone. We need salt against the
heat. Aside from that, we're doing very well, thank you. 
MCCOY: I'm pleased you're doing well but I'm required to confirm that
fact. 
CRATER: Doubtless the good surgeon will enjoy prodding and poking us
with his arcane machinery. Go away, we don't want you. 
MCCOY: What you want is unimportant right now. What you will get is
required by the book. 
KIRK: Quote. All research personnel on alien planets are required to
have their health certified by a starship surgeon at one year
intervals. Like it or not, Professor, as commander of the starship, I'm
required 
CRATER: To show your gold braid to everyone. You love it, don't you. 
KIRK: He's all yours, Plum. Doctor McCoy. 
MCCOY: Sit down and breathe deeply, please. 
CRATER: Did I hear you call him Doctor McCoy? 
MCCOY: You did. 
CRATER: McCoy. I've heard Nancy speak of a Doctor McCoy. 
MCCOY: That's me. Didn't she mention I was here? 
CRATER: You've seen Nancy? 
KIRK: She went out to get you. 
CRATER: You've seen her too? You were with the good Doctor? 
KIRK: Yes. Why? 
CRATER: Nothing. It's just that it gives me pleasure to know that she's
gotten to see an old friend and has a chance for some company. It's
different for me, I enjoy solitude. But for a woman. You understand, of
course. 
MCCOY: Well, it certainly hasn't aged her. She looks exactly as I knew
her twelve years ago. Amazing, Jim. Like a girl of twenty five. 
CRATER: Sorry. I'm sorry, Captain, sit down. I seem to have forgotten
my manners. 
KIRK: Quite all right. 
MCCOY: I'm not joking, Jim. She hasn't aged a day. She doesn't have a
grey hair on her head. 
KIRK: She's got some grey, Bones. Excuse me, Professor, she's a
handsome woman, yes, but hardly twenty five. 
CRATER: You've seen my wife with the eyes of your past attachment,
Doctor. I'm sure when Nancy lets, when you see her again she'll be a
believable age. 
MCCOY: Well at any rate she doesn't look a day over thirty. 
CRATER: Genuine affection. I'm glad you still feel it for her. Leonard,
isn't it? She's a fine woman. 
MCCOY: Open your mouth. 
CRATER: Why, I thought the machine 
MCCOY: The machine is capable of almost anything but I'll still put my
trust in a healthy set of tonsils. Now, open your mouth. (a woman
screams, they dash out, Kirk with his phaser drawn)
[Planet
surface]
(Darnell is lying on a rock, Nancy is standing by him) 
KIRK: (removing a piece of plant from Darnell's mouth) McCoy. 
MCCOY: Dead, Jim. Strange. A red mottling all over his face. 
KIRK: What happened? 
CRATER: What do you suppose happened, Captain? You beam down a crewman
who doesn't know better than to eat an untested plant. 
KIRK: I've just lost a crewman, Mrs. Crater. I want to know what
happened. 
NANCY: Well, I, I 
MCCOY: Take it easy, Nancy. Just tell us what you know. 
NANCY: I was just. I couldn't find Bob, and I was coming back. I
crossed to your crewman. I wanted him to know I wasn't offended by the
things he'd said back there. You remember. Then I, I noticed he had a
Borgia plant in his hand. Before I could say anything, he, he'd taken a
bite from it. He fell, his face all twisted, and. Leonard, you're
looking at me like you don't believe me. 
MCCOY: No, no, no, no, it's not that. It's something entirely
different. Jim, I suppose we could complete these examinations later. 
CRATER: We don't need an examination, you can see that. Perhaps you'd
better take your man and 
KIRK: We're well aware of our next duties, Professor. We'll complete
your examinations tomorrow. Transporter room. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Transporter room, Captain. 
KIRK: Lock onto us. Three beaming up. 
SCOTT [OC]: Locked onto you, Captain. 
NANCY: Salt. You did ask them about more salt tablets? 
CRATER: I'll take care of the provisioning, Nancy.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Miss Uhura, your last sub-space log contained an error in the
frequencies column. 
UHURA: Mister Spock, sometimes I think if I hear that word frequency
once more, I'll cry. 
SPOCK: Cry? 
UHURA: I was just trying to start a conversation. 
SPOCK: Well, since it is illogical for a communications officer to
resent the word frequency, I have no answer.
UHURA: No, you have an answer. I'm an illogical woman who's beginning
to feel too much a part of that communications console. Why don't you
tell me I'm an attractive young lady, or ask me if I've ever been in
love? Tell me how your planet Vulcan looks on a lazy evening when the
moon is full. 
SPOCK: Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura. 
UHURA: I'm not surprised, Mister Spock. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Transporter room to Bridge. Landing party returning. They
report one death. 
SPOCK: Bridge acknowledging. 
UHURA: I don't believe it. 
SPOCK: Explain. 
UHURA: You explain. That means that somebody is dead and you just sit
there. It could be Captain Kirk. He's the closest thing you have to a
friend. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern will not change what
happened. The transporter room is very well-manned and they will call
if they need my assistance. 
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: She called it a Borgia plant. 
KIRK: Something new to me. 
SPOCK [OC]: Bridge to Dispensary. 
KIRK: Go ahead, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK [on monitor]: Borgia plant listed in library record tapes as
carbon group three vegetation similar to Earth nightshade family.
Alkaloid poison. Chemical structure common to class M planets. About
the strange mottling on his facial skin surface. There is no reference
to this symptom. 
MCCOY: Hmm. Well then, this man wasn't poisoned. 
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Spock. She said she saw him eat the plant. 
MCCOY: She's mistaken. I know alkaloid poison, what to look for.
There's not a trace of it in his body. 
KIRK: There were bits of the plant in his mouth. 
MCCOY: Jim, don't tell me my business. He could not have swallowed any.
My instruments would have picked up any trace of it whatsoever. 
KIRK: Then what kills a healthy man 
MCCOY: I'll tell you something else. This man shouldn't be dead. I
can't find anything wrong with him. According to all the tests he
should just get up and walk away from here. I don't know. I'll have the
tests double-checked. My eyes may be tricking me. I swear, Jim, when I
first saw her she looked just as I'd known her ten years ago. Granted,
for a moment I may have been looking at her through a romantic haze. 
KIRK: How your lost love affects your vision, Doctor, doesn't interest
me. I've lost a man. I want to know what killed him. 
MCCOY: Yes, sir.
Captain's log, Stardate 1513.4. In orbit around planet M-113. One
crewman, member of the landing party, dead by violence.
Cause unknown, but we are certain the cause of death was not poison.
[Bridge]
UHURA: Message, Captain. Starship base on Caran 4 requesting
explanation of our delay here, sir. Space Commander Dominguez says we
have supplies he urgently needs. 
Tell Jose he'll get his chili peppers when we get there. Tell him
they're prime Mexican reds. I handpicked them myself, but he won't die
if he goes a few more days without them. Got it? 
UHURA: Got it, Captain. 
KIRK: Well? 
SPOCK: No mistake in our record tapes. Borgia plant. Its sole deadly
property is alkaloid poison. 
KIRK: And Professor Crater and wife? 
SPOCK: Check out perfectly. They arrived here nearly five years ago.
Visited by various vessels, made fairly heavy shipments out, of
artefacts and reports. However, there has been a marked drop in
shipments during the last year. 
MCCOY [OC]: Dispensary to Captain. 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
MCCOY [OC]: We found something. 
KIRK: What is it? 
MCCOY: I'd rather not put it on the speaker. 
[Sickbay]
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
MCCOY: So improbable we almost didn't check it. 
KIRK: What? 
SPOCK: Sodium chloride. Not a trace of it. 
MCCOY: This man has no salt in his body at all. 
KIRK: Can you explain that, Doctor? 
MCCOY: I can't, except that what we normally carry in our bodies is
gone from his. 
SPOCK: He would die almost instantly. 
KIRK: How? There isn't a mark on his body. 
MCCOY: Except the red rings on his face. 
KIRK: You called that skin mottling. 
MCCOY: I thought it was, sir. Another error on my part. 
KIRK: I'm not counting them, Bones. Are you in the mood for an apology?
MCCOY: Oh, forget it. I probably was mooning over her. I should have
been thinking about my job. 
KIRK: Perhaps you were. Both Nancy and Crater went out of their way to
mention one item they needed. 
MCCOY: Salt tablets. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, outfit a landing party. We're beaming down with
some questions.
[Crater's
home]
CRATER: One might think that you had more important duties than
harassing people, Captain. 
KIRK: I have, Professor. Believe me, I have. Where is Mrs. Crater? I
want to talk to her, too. 
CRATER: Captain, you can't just beam down here and bully us, and
interfere with our work. 
KIRK: Mrs. Crater. I won't ask again. 
CRATER: Possibly at the other diggings. We don't keep military logs 
KIRK: Green, find her. 
GREEN: Yes, sir. (leaves) 
KIRK: Mister Spock. 
SPOCK [OC]: Standing by. 
KIRK: Sturgeon, transport a sample of the plant to Mister Spock. We'll
check if it's actually the Borgia plant or something we don't
understand. (Sturgeon leaves) You got that, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK [OC]: Complete analysis. 
CRATER: Captain, considering the inescapable fact that you are a
trespasser on my planet 
KIRK: Your complaint is noted, sir. Look, something we don't understand
killed one of my men. It could prove to be a danger to you and Mrs.
Crater, too. 
CRATER: We've been here for almost five years. If there were anything
hostile here we would know about it, wouldn't we? 
KIRK: Bones, tell the professor what the autopsy revealed. 
MCCOY: Our crewman died of salt depletion. Sudden, total loss of it.
Medically impossible by any standards. 
KIRK: And by coincidence, both you and Mrs. Crater requested salt
tablets. 
CRATER: And your esteemed physician cannot explain our need for salt
tablets? 
KIRK: We're all aware of the need for salt on a hot and arid planet
like this, Professor, but it's a mystery, and I don't like mysteries.
They give me a bellyache and I've got a beauty right now. 
CRATER: (opening storage box) Nancy and I started with twenty five
pounds. This is what we have left. (a few tablets at the bottom of a
jar) Now what is so mysterious about that? 
MCCOY: (checking tablets) Salt. 
KIRK: One of the missions of the Enterprise is to protect human life in
places like this. I'm going to have to ask you and Mrs. Crater to stay
aboard my ship until we find out what killed that crewman. 
CRATER: But you can't do that. 
KIRK: But I can, Professor. 
How? You've been here five years. Will a couple of days make a
difference? Mister Spock. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. 
KIRK: Arrange quarters for Professor and Mrs. Crater. Did you get the
plant analysis? 
SPOCK [OC]: It is the Borgia variety, Captain. Could not have caused
Darnell's death. 
MCCOY: Jim, he's run off. 
(Crater finds Sturgeon's body) 
CRATER: Nancy! You! Salt! I've got salt! Smell it! Smell it, Nancy!
(Nancy is kneeling by Green's body. She stands at the call) 
KIRK [OC]: Professor Crater! Professor Crater! 
MCCOY [OC]: Professor Crater! 
KIRK: Professor Crater! Professor! Professor! 
MCCOY: Jim! Jim, it's Sturgeon. He's dead. 
KIRK: We'd better locate Crewman Green. Green! Green! Crewman Green,
report! Green! (Nancy changes into Green) 
MCCOY: Crewman Green, report! Green! Green, where are you? Could it be
Crater? He came this way. 
KIRK: I don't know. Green! (Green arrives) Did you see this? 
GREEN: Yes, sir. Sturgeon was dead when I found him. I was circling to
find whatever it was. 
MCCOY: Same red rings on his face. Have you seen Nancy, Mrs. Crater? 
GREEN: No, sir. I checked all through the ruins. 
MCCOY: I'm worried about her, Jim. She's not at the quarters, she's not
at the diggings. She could be in trouble. Nancy! 
KIRK: Crater! 
MCCOY: Nancy, it's Leonard! 
KIRK: We're beaming aboard the ship, Doctor. 
MCCOY: You can't leave her! 
KIRK: We can't search this whole planet on foot. 
MCCOY: Jim! 
KIRK: You could learn something from Mister Spock, Doctor. Stop
thinking with your glands. We've equipment aboard the Enterprise that
could pinpoint a match lit anywhere on this planet, or the heat of a
body. Transporter room, Kirk speaking. Three to beam up.
[Transporter
room]
KIRK: Kirk to Bridge. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. 
KIRK: Break out the surface search equipment. I want co-ordinates on
two people. 
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledged. 
KIRK: There's a body down there. Sturgeon. 
TRANSPORTER OPERATOR: We'll bring him home, sir. 
KIRK: You could use some sleep, Bones. 
MCCOY: All right, Jim.
[Turbolift]
KIRK: Bridge.
[Corridor]
RAND: Oh, Green, what went on down there? (he reaches for the salt
cellar) Who do you think you are? (they enter turbolift)
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Something odd, Captain. You said two people. 
KIRK: Professor and Nancy Crater. 
SPOCK: We get a reading on only one person, probably Crater. He's
circling as if searching for something. 
KIRK: Expand search radius. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
[Corridor]
(Green is following Rand) 
RAND: Why don't you go chase an asteroid? 
REDSHIRT: Hey, Janice, is that for me? 
RAND: Don't you wish it was? 
BLUESHIRT: How about that? 
REDSHIRT: Yeah, how'd you like to have her as your personal yeoman?
[Life
Sciences Section - Botany department]
RAND: Where are you, Sulu? 
SULU: In here feeding the weepers, Janice. 
RAND: I've got your tray. 
SULU: May the Great Bird of the Galaxy bless your planet. 
RAND: Thank you. Hello, Beauregard. How are you today, darling? 
SULU: Her name's Gertrude. 
RAND: No, it's a he plant. A girl can tell. 
SULU: Why do people have to call inanimate objects she, like she's a
fast ship. 
RAND: He is not an inanimate object. He's so animate he makes me
nervous. In fact, I keep expecting one of these plants of yours to grab
me. 
SULU: Hello, Green. 
RAND: He's not talking today. You been nipping saurian brandy or
something? 
(Beauregard starts screeching and slithers down into it's stem. Green
rushes out) 
SULU: (stroking plant) Take it easy. Calm down. Very sensitive. 
RAND: He's the real spook. Suppose he's going space happy or something?
[Corridor]
UHURA (to crewmen) The door to my quarters still rattles when it opens.
Would you stop by and see if you can do something about it? Thanks,
Bobby. (Green changes into African crewman) Crewman, do I know you? 
CREWMAN: In a way, ma'am. You were just thinking of someone like me.
I'm guessing of course, but you do look a little lonely. 
UHURA: I see. So naturally, when I'm lonely I think of you. 
CREWMAN: Ina cuvanea mwanamke turee. 
UHURA: Una kafeeri Hur. You're Swahili? 
KIRK [OC]: Lieutenant Uhura to the Bridge. (the crewman begins to reach
for her face) Lieutenant Uhura to the Bridge. 
RAND: I'd better get this tray back. Bye, Beauregard. 
SULU: Wait a minute, I'll walk along. 
KIRK [OC]: Lieutenant Uhura, report to the Bridge. 
UHURA: Lieutenant Uhura. On my way, sir.
[McCoy's
quarters]
MCCOY: McCoy to Bridge. Captain there? 
KIRK [on monitor]: Kirk here. Nothing to report, Doctor. We haven't
located Mrs. Crater. What's the matter, can't you sleep? 
MCCOY: Nope. 
KIRK [on monitor]: Try taking one of those red pills you gave me last
week. You'll sleep.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: The simple fact is unless there's something seriously wrong with
the ship's equipment, there's only one person within a one hundred mile
circle. 
KIRK: All right. We'll triangulate on him. We'll let Professor Crater
explain what happened to his wife. (to Uhura) Remember my instructions,
Lieutenant. Keep a tight fix on us. If we let out a yell I want an
armed party down there before the echo dies. 
UHURA: Yes, Captain. 
[McCoy's
quarters]
(Uhura's crewman has found McCoy's quarters, and transforms into Nancy)
MCCOY: Nancy. Well, come in. come in. I've been worried sick about you.
I wonder why Jim didn't tell me he found you. 
NANCY: I'm so happy to see you, Leonard. The others, they, I, I don't
relate to them as much as you. You have such strong memories of me. 
MCCOY: Well. 
NANCY: You do care, don't you, Leonard? It makes me feel so, so safe.
MCCOY: Nancy, er 
NANCY: My husband? I like your feelings better. Much stronger. But
you're tired, You need to rest. 
MCCOY: You're as bad as Jim Kirk. He's been telling me to take these. 
NANCY: I think you should. I'll get you some water.
[Corridor]
(a
crewman lies dead, with mottles on his face) 
RAND: Look at his face! 
SULU: Bridge. Sulu. Trouble on deck nine, section two. We need a
medical team.
Captain's log, Stardate 1513.8. I am now certain that the violent death
of my crewmen was caused by some strange life-form.
[McCoy's
quarters]
MCCOY: (lying on bed) I was so worried. Your husband acting strange,
crewmen dying. 
NANCY: You're so tired, darling. Just rest now. 
UHURA [OC]: Medical department alert. Doctors and medics acknowledge. 
NANCY: It's nothing, dear. It's nothing. You just sleep. Nancy will
take care of everything. 
UHURA [OC]: Dr. McCoy to the Bridge. Dr. McCoy to the Bridge. (Nancy
changes to McCoy) Dr. McCoy to the Bridge.
Captain's log, additional. Armed and able-bodied crewmen are not
attacked and slaughtered this easily. Apparently, the killer can
immobilize them as it approaches perhaps with some hypnotic or
paralysing power. The answer lies with Professor Crater.
[Planet
surface - ruins]
KIRK: Professor Crater. 
CRATER: Go away! We don't want you here. 
KIRK: We? Where's your wife, Professor? We're concerned about her. 
CRATER: I'm armed. Go away. 
KIRK: Where's your wife, Professor? 
CRATER: She's no concern of yours. 
KIRK: We're worried about her safety. Aren't you? Professor, you're a
reasonable man, let me (comm. beep) Kirk here. 
SULU [OC]: Casualty, Captain. Barnhart was found dead on deck nine.
Same symptoms. 
SPOCK: Spock cutting in, Captain. Something here, through the arches to
your left. 
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Sulu. Spock has something. 
SPOCK: Green. 
KIRK: He beamed up to the ship with us. 
SPOCK: Or something did.
KIRK: Enterprise from Kirk. 
SULU [OC]: Bridge. Sulu. 
KIRK: You have an intruder aboard. Could be masquerading as Crewman
Green. General quarters, security condition three. 
SULU [OC]: GQ security three, sir.
[Corridor]
SULU [OC]: General quarters three. Intruder alert. GQ three. Intruder
alert. General quarters three. Intruder alert. GQ three. Intruder alert.UHURA [OC]: Reporting GQ three secure, Captain. Do you require
assistance there? 
SPOCK: Crater knows the creature. If we could take him alive. 
KIRK: Negative, Lieutenant, but keep locked in on us. Kirk out. Let's
get him. (phaser fire) 
CRATER: We don't want you here! We're happy alone! I'll kill to stay
alone. You hear that, Kirk? Or you'll have to kill me. II don't care
either way. 
SPOCK: Obviously, taking him alive is going to be difficult. 
KIRK: Set your phaser on one quarter. I'll leave mine on stun. 
SPOCK: Why risk your life for his? 
KIRK: He's not trying to kill us, he's trying to frighten us, and he's
doing a pretty good job.
[Bridge]
SULU: GQ three now secured except for decks five, seven, and ten. Come
in, please. 
UHURA: He's not in supply and maintenance. 
SULU: Go to Engineering now. Run through file photos of the crewmen
there. 
UHURA: Check. 
SECURITY [OC]: Deck five reporting. Crewman Green is not in his
quarters. No one has seen him 
SULU: Keep in mind if you find him, he's not Crewman Green. The Captain
reports Crewman Green is dead. 
RAND: And he, or rather it, followed me. I thought there was something
twitchy about him. 
SULU: He, whatever, was probably your crewman, too, Lieutenant. 
UHURA: He must have been it. You know, I would have remembered a
crewman like him. 
MCCOY: The creature leading you a merry chase, Mister Sulu? 
SULU: The creature? 
MCCOY: Or whatever it is that's killing the crewmen. Perhaps I can
help. Fill me in.
[Planet
surface - ruins]
(Spock and Kirk are circling around Crater from different directions) 
KIRK: Set.
SPOCK: Acknowledged. Crater! (Kirk fires his phaser) 
KIRK: Your wife, Professor. Where is she? Your wife, Professor. Where
is she? 
CRATER: She was the last of her kind. 
KIRK: The last of her kind? 
CRATER: The last of its kind. Earth history, remember? Like the
passenger pigeon or buffalo. Ooh! I feel strange. 
KIRK: Just stunned. You'll be able to think in a minute. 
SPOCK: The Earth buffalo. What about it? 
CRATER: Once there were millions of them prairies black with them. One
herd covered three whole states, and when they moved they were like
thunder. 
SPOCK: And now they're gone. Is that what you mean? 
CRATER: Like the creatures here. Once there were millions of them. Now
there's one left. Nancy understood.
SPOCK: Always in the past tense.
KIRK: Where's your wife? Where is she now? 
CRATER: Dead. Buried up on the hill. It killed her. 
KIRK: When? 
CRATER: Oh, a year, or was it two? 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. 
SULU [OC]: Bridge to Captain. Sulu here. 
KIRK: It's definite, Mister Sulu. The intruder can assume any shape.
Crewmen, you, myself, anyone. Do you understand? 
SULU [OC]: Affirmative, Captain. 
KIRK: Go to GQ four. 
SULU [OC]: General quarters four, Captain. 
CRATER: The creature was trying to survive. It has that right, doesn't
it? 
KIRK: Kirk to transporter room. Three to beam up. 
CRATER: They needed salt to stay alive. There was no more salt. It's
the last one. The buffalo. There is no difference. 
KIRK: There's one, Professor. Your creature is killing my people.
Captain's log, continuing. The Enterprise has been invaded by a
creature capable of assuming any form, and with the capacity to
paralyse and draw the life from any one of us.
[Corridor]
SULU [OC]: Deck five, section three. Deck five, section three. Report. 
SECURITY: Security 3 A here. 3 B in sight.
[Briefing
room]
UHURA: Negative, Captain. I've checked every face on this vessel. It
was not a crewman I saw. 
KIRK: Yeoman Rand, how long was this Green with you? 
RAND: As long as he, it thought it could get to the salt on my tray,
sir. 
KIRK: Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Supplies of salt have been set out as bait at all decks and
engineering levels, Captain. However, no one or nothing has approached
them as yet. 
KIRK: Dr. McCoy? 
MCCOY: Yes? 
KIRK: Medical department report, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Oh. Well, we could offer it salt without tricks. There's no
reason for it to attack us. 
SPOCK: Your attitude is laudable, Doctor, but your reasoning is
reckless. 
CRATER: (eyeing McCoy carefully) The creature is not dangerous when
fed. 
MCCOY: No, it's simply trying to survive by using its natural ability
to take other forms. 
CRATER: The way the chameleon uses its protective colouring, an ability
retained no doubt from its primitive state, the way we have retained
our incisor teeth. They were once fangs. Certain of our muscles were
designed for chase. It uses its ability the way we would use our
muscles and teeth if necessary, to stay alive. 
MCCOY: And like us, it's an intelligent animal. There's no need to hunt
it down. 
SPOCK: A very interesting hypothesis, Doctor. Briefing room. 
SULU [on monitor] All the halls sealed off. All weapons accounted for
and locked away. Security four in effect on every level. Still no lead
on intruder. 
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Continue the search. Crater, we don't know
who or what we're looking for. We need your help, and now. 
CRATER: I demanded, I even begged that you get off my planet. 
KIRK: Can you recognise this thing When you see it? Professor, I'll
forego charges up to this point but this creature's aboard my ship and
I'll have it, or I'll have your skin, or both. Now where is it? 
CRATER: I loved Nancy very much. Few women like my Nancy. She lives in
my dreams. She walks and sings in them. 
KIRK: And it becomes Nancy for you. 
CRATER: Not because of tricks. It doesn't trick me. It needs love as
much as it needs salt. When it killed Nancy, I almost destroyed it but,
it isn't just a beast. It is intelligent and the last of its kind. 
KIRK: You bleed too much, Crater. You're too pure and noble. Are you
saving the last of its kind or has this become Crater's private heaven,
here on this planet? This thing becomes wife, lover, best friend, wise
man, fool, idol, slave. It isn't a bad life to have everyone in the
universe at your beck and call, and you win all the arguments. 
CRATER: You don't understand. 
KIRK: Have you learned to see this thing in whatever form it becomes? 
CRATER: Yes. 
KIRK: Are you going to help us find it? 
CRATER: Sorry, I can't. 
SPOCK: Recommend we use truth serum, Captain. 
KIRK: Doctor? 
MCCOY: Well, I resist using it, but in this case the professor will
give us the truth. 
KIRK: Take him. 
SPOCK: I'll accompany you, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Oh, yes. Of course.
[Corridor]
CREWMAN [OC]: Captain Kirk to dispensary. Captain Kirk to dispensary.
[Sickbay]
SPOCK: (on biobed) It wasn't McCoy. It was the creature. It hit me.
Crater grabbed my phaser. I wondered about McCoy. Doubt had crossed my
mind. 
RAND: Captain. Professor Crater. 
KIRK: Dead. But it had you, too. 
SPOCK: Fortunately, my ancestors spawned in another ocean than yours
did. My blood cells are quite different.
[McCoy's
quarters]
NANCY: Leonard. Leonard, wake up. Please help me. Help me, Leonard.
They're trying to kill me. Don't let them kill me! 
MCCOY: Easy, easy. Nobodies going to 
NANCY: But you must help me! 
KIRK: Move aside, Bones. 
MCCOY: What's going on here, Jim? 
KIRK: She's not Nancy, Bones.
MCCOY: Are you insane? 
KIRK: It killed four crewmen. Now Crater.
MCCOY: It? 
KIRK: The creature. It kills. It needs salt to live. Bones, move aside.
MCCOY: No! 
KIRK: My guess is she needs more. You want it, Nancy? Come and get it. 
MCCOY: You're frightening her, Jim.
KIRK: Not fright. Hunger. Look at her. 
NANCY: Leonard, if you love me, make him go away. 
KIRK: Come on. You want this, Nancy? Come on Nancy. Come and get it.
Come and get it. Here it is. 
NANCY: Leonard, help me. 
MCCOY: Stop it, Jim! 
KIRK: McCoy, get out of the way! 
MCCOY: Are you out of your mind? 
KIRK: Get out of the way. (McCoy and Kirk struggle for the phaser while
Nancy grabs and eats the salt tablets. McCoy wins and is pushed away,
then she transfixes Kirk and reaches for his face) 
SPOCK: It's killing the Captain. Shoot it, Doctor, quickly! 
MCCOY: No! No! (They struggle for the phaser. Spock gets between Nancy and Kirk.) 
SPOCK: It's killing the captain!
Shoot, quick! 
MCCOY: I won't shoot Nancy. 
SPOCK: This is not Nancy. (hitting her repeatedly) If she were Nancy,
could she take this? 
MCCOY: Stop it! Stop it, Spock! Stop it! (Nancy sends Spock flying with
one slap) 
SPOCK: Is that Nancy, Doctor? 
MCCOY: No. (she goes to Kirk again) No! (She transforms into her
natural state. Kirk screams, McCoy fires the phaser, she changes back into Nancy) 
NANCY: Leonard. Leonard, no. Leonard, please. 
MCCOY: Lord, forgive me. (He fires again and she dies) 
KIRK: I'm sorry, Bones. 
[Bridge]
SULU: Ready to leave orbit, Captain. 
SPOCK: Something wrong, Captain? 
KIRK: I was thinking about the buffalo, Mister Spock. Warp one, Mister
Sulu. 
SULU: Warp one, sir. Leaving orbit.

Stardate:
1533.6
Original Airdate: 15 Sep, 1966
 
Captain's Log, star date 1533.6. Now manoeuvring to come alongside
cargo vessel Antares. Its Captain and First officer
are beaming over to us with an unusual passenger.
[Transporter room]
KIRK: All right, Chief, begin materialisation.
Captain Ramart, I'm Captain Kirk. 
RAMART: This is my navigator Tom Nellis. 
KIRK: How do you do? 
NELLIS: How do you do? 
RAMART: And this is our young castaway Charlie, Charlie Evans. His
dossier. 
KIRK: Mister Evans. We've heard a great deal about you. Welcome aboard.
RAMART: Wonderful boy, Charlie. Its been an honour having him aboard. 
NELLIS: Why, it's been a great pleasure. The things that he's learned
in the last 
RAMART: Absolutely. To think this boy spent practically his whole life
alone on that planet. Everyone killed, just a few microtapes to learn
from. 
CHARLIE: How many humans like me on this ship? 
RAMART: Like a whole city in space, Charlie. Over four hundred in the
crew of a starship, aren't there, Captain? 
KIRK: Four hundred and twenty eight, to be exact. Is there anything we
can do for you, Captain? Medical supplies, provisions? 
CHARLIE: Hundreds. All human, like me. That's exciting. Is that the
right word? 
NELLIS: That's perfect. It's the exact word. 
RAMART: You see. We'd like to keep Charlie with us, but with his
closest living relatives on Colony Five and your vessel going that way,
why 
CHARLIE: I'd like to see your ship now. All of it. The people and
everything. 
KIRK: You keep interrupting, Mister Evans. That's considered wrong. 
CHARLIE: I'm sorry. 
KIRK: We have a large supply of entertainment tapes, gentlemen. 
RAMART: No, we've a tight schedule to make, Captain. Just twenty of us,
we're making out fine. 
KIRK: This must be a space first. A transport ship that doesn't need
anything? 
RAMART: Nothing. 
KIRK: Not even Sarian brandy? 
RAMART: We're fine, thank you. Pleasant journey, Captain. 
KIRK: Thank you. (the pair are beamed off) 
KIRK: Yeoman Rand, this is Charles Evans. Show him to his quarters and
drop his records off at Doctor McCoy's office, if you will. 
RAND: Yes, sir. Come with me, please. 
CHARLIE: Are you a girl? Is that a girl? 
KIRK: That's a girl.
Captain's Log, star date 1533.7. We have taken
aboard an unusual passenger for transport to Colony Alpha Five. Charles
Evans,
the sole survivor of a transport crash fourteen years ago. The child,
alone from age three, has not only survived, but has grown to
intelligent, healthy adolescence.
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: Tell me. The ship's supply of food
concentrates couldn't have lasted fourteen years. 
CHARLIE: After that I found other things to eat, just growing around. 
MCCOY: And you learned to talk by just listening to the ship's tapes? 
CHARLIE: The memory banks still worked. They talked to me, and I talked
back. 
MCCOY: You're four-oh. 
CHARLIE: Four? 
MCCOY: Four-oh. One hundred percent. Sound of wind and limb. 
CHARLIE: That, that Captain. Kirk? 
MCCOY: Yeah. 
CHARLIE: Why does he call me Mister Evans? 
MCCOY: Because that's your name. 
CHARLIE: He's not, well, he isn't like Captain Ramart. 
MCCOY: Well, no. Captain Kirk is one of a kind, Charlie. 
CHARLIE: Do you like me? 
MCCOY: Why not? 
CHARLIE: Some, the other ship, they didn't like me. I tried. I'm trying
to make people like me. I want them to like me. 
MCCOY: Most seventeen year olds do. Come on, let's go. I'll show you to
your quarters.
[Corridor]
CREWMAN 1: Hey, I'll put the equipment away. See
you in the rec room, huh? 
CREWMAN 2: You got a deal, friend. (slaps man on bottom) 
CREWMAN 1: All right. (to Charlie) Hello.
CHARLIE: I brought you a present.
(A bottle of perfume.) 
RAND: Oh, thank you. I really appreciate it, but, but I have to go. I'm
on duty. 
CHARLIE: Do you like that kind? 
RAND: Yes, I, it's my favourite. Where did you get it? They don't have
any in the ship's stores.
CHARLIE: It's a present. 
RAND: I know, but where did? Gee, I'm late, Charlie. I really have to
go. 
CHARLIE: Can't you stay and talk a little while? 
RAND: Look, I'm off duty at fourteen hundred. Why don't you join me in
recreation room six, deck three. 
CHARLIE: You got a deal, friend. (slaps her bottom) 
RAND: Charlie! 
CHARLIE: I thought. Don't be angry. I didn't, I wanted. 
RAND: Charlie, you, you, you just don't go around slapping girls on
the. It's okay, but er, just don't do it again. 
CHARLIE: Don't be angry. 
RAND: Look, why don't you tell Captain Kirk or Doctor McCoy what you
did. They'll explain it to you. Okay? 
CHARLIE: I will. 
RAND: Okay.
[Bridge]
MCCOY: But tell me, what reason would he have to
lie if there are Thasians? 
SPOCK: That is a very intriguing question. Scanners show no
disturbances in this quadrant, Captain. 
KIRK: Good. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock is working out 
UHURA: Excuse me, Captain. Status report. 
KIRK: Thank you. He's working out a training programme for Charlie
Evans. Earth history, his own background, that sort of thing. I'd like
you to give him the necessary medical orientation on the problems of,
um, er, adolescence. 
MCCOY: Well, don't you think it'd be better for a strong father image
like you? He already looks up to you. 
KIRK: The job is yours, Bones. Flattery will get you nowhere. 
SPOCK: Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians? 
KIRK: Do you believe the legend, Mister Spock, that Thasians still
exist on that planet in some form? 
SPOCK: Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some
intelligent form of life on Thasus. He could not possibly have survived
alone. The ship's food concentrates would have been exhausted in a year
or so. 
MCCOY: By which time he would have been eating fruits, vegetables. 
SPOCK: Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life. 
MCCOY: And probes have been known to be wrong, Spock. 
MCCOY: Doctor, are you speaking scientifically or emotionally? 
KIRK: Gentlemen, the fact is the boy is here and he's alive and he
needs our help. 
MCCOY: And he needs a guide and he needs a father image, Jim. 
KIRK: Hmm. I'll depend on your astute abilities to supply him with
that, or find him one.
[Recreation room]
(Spock is strumming his lyre when Uhura starts
humming. Spock stops) 
UHURA: I'm sorry. I did it again, didn't I. 
(Spock smirks and Uhura begins playing again.) 
UHURA: (singing) Oh, on the starship Enterprise
There's someone who's in Satan's guise Whose devil ears and devil eyes
Could rip your heart from you. At first, his look could
hypnotise And then his touch would barbarise His alien love could
victimise And rip your heart from you. And that's why female
astronauts, Oh, very female astronauts Wait terrified and overwrought
To find what he will do. Oh, girls in space, be wary, be wary, be wary,
Girls in space, be wary. We know not what he'll do. 
RAND: One more time! 
UHURA: (singing) Now from a planet out in space, there comes a lad, not
commonplace. A-seeking out his first embrace. He's saving it for you.
Oh, Charlie's our new darling, our darling, our darling. Charlie's our
new darling. We know not what he'll do. 
(Uhura suddenly loses her voice and the lyre makes no sound.) 
CHARLIE: Want to see something? (puts three cards face down) Turn them
over.
(They have pictures of Rand on them) 
RAND: Well, how did you do that? 
CHARLIE: Oh, I can do a lot of card tricks. One of the men on the
Antares showed me. 
(The cards return to normal) 
RAND: I don't believe this! 
(Hhe lays out the aces, throws one over his shoulder, then Rand removes
it from her cleavage)
[Corridor]
KIRK: On Earth today, it's Thanksgiving. If the
crew has to eat synthetic meat loaf, I want it to look like turkey.
Charlie. 
CHARLIE: Captain? I'm supposed to ask you something. Why shouldn't I? I
don't know how to explain it. 
KIRK: Say it right out, Charlie. That usually works. 
CHARLIE: Well, in the corridor I saw. When Janice, when Yeoman Rand
was. (slaps Kirk's bottom) I did that to her. She didn't like it. She
said you'd explain it to me. 
KIRK: Me. I see. Well, um, er, there are things you can do with a lady,
er, Charlie, that you er. There's no right way to hit a woman. I mean,
man to man is one thing, but, er, man and woman, er, it's, er, it's,
er. Well it's, er, another thing. Do you understand? 
CHARLIE: I don't know. 
UHURA [OC]: Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: Excuse me. Kirk here. 
UHURA [OC]: Captain Ramart of the Antares is on D channel. 
KIRK: I'm on my way to the Bridge now. 
CHARLIE: Can I come with you? 
KIRK: I don't think so, Charlie. 
CHARLIE: I won't get in the way. 
KIRK: Okay. 
[Bridge]
UHURA: Can you boost your power, Antares. We're
barely reading your transmission. 
RAMART [OC]: We're at full output, Enterprise. I must speak to Captain
Kirk. 
KIRK: Kirk here, Captain Ramart. 
RAMART [OC]: Captain, we're just barely in range. I've got to warn 
KIRK: Re-establish contact. 
UHURA: They're not transmitting. 
KIRK: Keep trying. 
CHARLIE: It wasn't very well constructed. 
KIRK: Sweep the area of the Antares transmission with our probe
scanners, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Affirmative, Captain. 
KIRK: You think something happened to the Antares, Charlie? 
CHARLIE: I don't know. 
SPOCK: Picking up some debris on our scanners, Captain. 
KIRK: What about the Antares? 
SPOCK: The debris is what's left of the Antares. 
CHEF [OC]: Captain Kirk from ship's Galley. 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
CHEF [OC]: Sir, I put meat loaf in the ovens. There's turkeys in there
now. Real turkeys. 
KIRK: Chief, have you been 
(Charlie laughs and leaves.)
Captain's Log, star date 1535.8. UESPA headquarters
notified of the mysterious loss of science probe vessel Antares.
[Recreation room]
(Kirk and Spock are playing 3D chess) 
SPOCK: Your mind is not on the game, Captain. Check. The Antares? 
KIRK: A survey ship with twenty men aboard lost. No reason. Obviously,
Captain Ramart was not aware of any trouble. I can't figure it. 
SPOCK: My own concern is more immediate. The boy. 
KIRK: I can usually follow you, Mister Spock, but this time? 
SPOCK: He seemed to know what happened to the Antares before we did. 
KIRK: I'd call it a pretty long reach for evidence, Mister Spock. Come
in, Charlie. 
SPOCK: And again, check. 
KIRK: Checkmate. 
SPOCK: Your illogical approach to chess does have its advantages on
occasion, Captain. 
KIRK: I prefer to call it inspired. 
SPOCK: As you wish. At any rate, the game is yours. 
KIRK: You play chess, Charlie? 
CHARLIE: Oh, I, I watched them play on the Antares. Can I try? 
KIRK: I place you in the hands of our chess master. 
(Kirk gets up and leaves) 
SPOCK: The principles of three-dimensional chess are basically
mathematic, Charlie. You put the white here and the black on the
secondary level. 
CHARLIE: I know what it is. Let's play. 
SPOCK: Very well. (just three moves later) That was a mistake, Charlie.
CHARLIE: No, it wasn't. 
SPOCK: Checkmate. 
CHARLIE: No, it isn't. 
SPOCK: If you'll excuse me. 
(Spock leaves. Charlie melts the white chess pieces.) 
[Corridor]
RAND: Oh, Charlie. I was looking for you. I'd like
you to meet Tina Lawton, Yeoman Third Class. Charlie Evans. 
TINA: Hello, Charlie. 
RAND: I thought you might enjoy meeting someone your own age. 
CHARLIE: Can I talk to you, alone. 
RAND: Charlie, Tina's 
TINA: Excuse me. I must be wanted somewhere. 
RAND: That was, that was rude and completely uncalled-for. 
CHARLIE: But I don't need her. I want to talk to you. 
RAND: That's no excuse. You'd better learn that right now. You have to
live with people, Charlie. You're not alone anymore. 
CHARLIE: But she's not as. She doesn't. She's not the same. Not like
you. She's, she's just a girl. You're, you smell like a girl. All the
other girls on the ship they, they look just like Tina. You're the only
one who looks like you. You can understand, can't you? You know about
being with somebody? Wanting to be? If I had the whole universe I'd
give it to you. When I see you, I feel like I'm hungry all over.
Hungry. Do you know how that feels?
[Bridge]
KIRK: What? 
RAND: I wasn't sure I should, er, talk to you about this. 
KIRK: Charlie's a seventeen year old boy. 
RAND: Exactly, and he's 
KIRK: I talked to him about the swat.
RAND: It's not that. Captain, I've seen the look before, and if
something isn't done, sooner or later I'm going to have to hurt him.
Tell him to leave me alone, and that wouldn't be good for him right
now. You see, I'm his first crush, his first love, and his first 
KIRK: Yes, Yeoman, I'll talk to him. I'll look into it. 
RAND: Thank you, sir.
[Kirk's quarters]
KIRK: Come in, Charlie. Er, Charlie. Charlie, do
you know anything about this chess piece? Did you notice anything
peculiar in them when we were using them this afternoon? 
CHARLIE: No, sir. Is that all? 
KIRK: Er, no. No, no. Sit down. Charlie, being seventeen is more than
how many years you've lived. It's a whole other thing.
Doctor McCoy could probably explain the biological conditions. Well,
let's, let's use a specific. Yeoman Rand is a woman. 
CHARLIE: Oh, I won't hit her like that anymore. 
KIRK: No, there's more to it than that.
CHARLIE: Everything I do or say is wrong. I'm in the way, I don't know
the rules, and when I learn something and try to do it, suddenly I'm
wrong! 
KIRK: Now wait, wait. 
CHARLIE: I don't know what I am or what I'm supposed to be, or even
who. I don't know why I hurt so much inside all the time. 
KIRK: You'll live, believe me. There's nothing wrong with you that
hasn't gone wrong with every other human male since the model first
came up. 
CHARLIE: What if you care for someone? What do you do? 
KIRK: You go slow. You be gentle. I mean, it's not a one-way street,
you know, how you feel and that's all. It's how the girl feels, too.
Don't press, Charlie. If the girl feels anything for you at all, you'll
know it. Do you understand? 
CHARLIE: You don't think Janice. You. She could love me! 
KIRK: She's not the girl, Charlie. The years are wrong, for one thing,
and there are other things. 
CHARLIE: She can.
KIRK: No, Charlie. 
CHARLIE: She is. 
KIRK: No.
CHARLIE: But if I did what you said! If I was gentle! 
KIRK: Charlie, there are a million things in this universe you can have
and there are a million things you can't have. It's no fun facing that,
but that's the way things are. 
CHARLIE: Then what am I going to do? 
KIRK: Hang on tight and survive. Everybody does. 
CHARLIE: You don't. 
KIRK: Everybody, Charlie. Me, too. 
CHARLIE: I'm trying, but I don't know how. 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
UHURA [OC]: You asked to be notified when we were to make our course
adjustments, sir. 
KIRK: Ask Mister Spock to see to it. Charlie, come on with me.
[Gymnasium]
KIRK: You've got to slap the floor to absorb the
energy when you fall. Go ahead, try it. Like everything else, it takes
practice, Charlie. Try again. Good. That's much better. Here, now I'll
show you a shoulder roll. Try that. 
CHARLIE: I don't want to do that. 
KIRK: Well, it makes it hard to teach you 
CHARLIE: I don't want to do that. 
KIRK: All right, Charlie. Lesson's over for today. 
CHARLIE: You were going to teach me how to fight. 
KIRK: You have to learn to protect yourself in a fall before I do that.
It's more than teaching you to defend yourself. Charlie, I want you to
learn. Charlie? Hey, Sam, let me borrow you for a couple easy throws,
all right? 
SAM: Right. 
KIRK: Watch this, Charlie. That wasn't so bad, was it? Now I'll throw
him. Here we go, Sam. 
CHARLIE: That looks hard. 
SAM: Oh. 
KIRK: Come on, Charlie. Try it. Attaboy. Let's go. 
(Charlie can't make Kirk lose his balance. He gets dumped instead.) 
CHARLIE: Oh! 
(Sam laughs.) 
KIRK: That wasn't so bad, was it? 
CHARLIE: Don't laugh at me. 
KIRK: Cool off. 
CHARLIE: Don't laugh at me! 
(Sam disappears.) 
KIRK: Charlie. 
CHARLIE: He shouldn't have done that. It's not nice to laugh at people.
KIRK: What happened to him, Charlie? 
CHARLIE: He's gone. 
KIRK: That's no answer. 
CHARLIE: He's gone! I didn't mean to do that. He made me do it! He
laughed at me. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Bridge. 
KIRK: Kirk here. Two men from security, on the double. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Affirmative. 
CHARLIE: What are you going to do to me? 
KIRK: I'm confining you to quarters. I want you to stay there. 
CHARLIE: I won't let them hurt me. I'll make them go away, too. 
KIRK: They won't hurt you, Charlie. (security arrive) They'll take you
to your quarters, Charlie. Go with them. 
(Charlie knocks them down, one draws his phaser) 
CHARLIE: No! (phaser disappears) 
KIRK: Go to your quarters. 
CHARLIE: He was going to hurt me. 
KIRK: Go to your quarters or I'll pick you up and carry you there. 
CHARLIE: I won't let you. 
KIRK: That's your choice, Charlie. 
CHARLIE: I won't let them hurt me. 
KIRK: They won't hurt you.
UHURA [OC]: Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
UHURA [OC]: Security reports that all phaser weapons have disappeared.
Shall I repeat, Captain? 
KIRK: No, I heard you. Have Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock meet me in
the Briefing room.
[Briefing room]
SPOCK: Thasians have been referred to in our
records as having the power to transmute objects or render substances
invisible.
It has generally been regarded as legend, but Charlie does seems to
possess this same power. 
KIRK: What are chances that Charlie's not an Earthling, that he's a
Thasian? 
MCCOY: No, I don't think so, not unless they're exactly like
Earthlings. The development of his fingers and toes exactly matches the
present development of mans on Earth. 
SPOCK: Agreed. 
KIRK: Well, whatever he is, we have some idea of the power he has. I
know what I saw him do in the gymnasium. 
MCCOY: Considering the effect a normal adolescent has on a home,
Charlie with the power he has 
KIRK: Short-tempered, because he doesn't understand. He needs, he
wants. Nothing happens fast enough. 
SPOCK: The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the
Antares, which would indicate a total disregard for human life. 
KIRK: He doesn't understand what life is. He's a boy. 
MCCOY: Well, what do we do with this boy, Jim? How do we keep him caged
up? 
KIRK: It goes even further than that, Doctor. We can't take him with us
to Earth Colony Five. Can you imagine what he'd do in an open, normal
environment. I've talked with him, listened. He's a boy in a man's
body, trying to be an adult with the adolescence in him getting in the
way. 
SPOCK: And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone,
anywhere on this ship. 
MCCOY: Well, for the moment he's stopped. You're an authority he
respects, Jim. 
SPOCK: Agreed. The struggle must remain between you and him. Should any
of us interfere 
(Charlie enters under guard) 
CHARLIE: You wanted to ask me something, he said. 
KIRK: Are you responsible for what happened to the Antares, Charlie? 
CHARLIE: Why? 
KIRK: Answer me. 
CHARLIE: Yes. There was a warped baffle-plate on the shield of their
energy pile. I made it go away. It would've blown up anyway. Well they
weren't nice to me! They wanted to get rid of me. They don't now. 
KIRK: What about us, Charlie? 
CHARLIE: I don't know. 
(Charlie leaves) 
SPOCK: We're in the hands of an adolescent.
[Bridge]
KIRK: Lieutenant, raise Colony Five. I want to
speak directly to the governor. 
UHURA: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: Navigator, lay a course away from Colony Five. Buy me some time. 
NAVIGATOR: Yes, sir. 
(Uhura's console short-circuits and she is thrown to the floor) 
KIRK: Spock, get the doctor up here on the double. How bad is it? 
UHURA: I think it's all right, sir. Sir, there's no reason for that
panel to cross-circuit like that. I checked it over myself not fifteen
minutes ago. 
NAVIGATOR: Captain! I can't feed any course co-ordinates into the
panel, sir. It rejects the course change. 
PILOT: Helm doesn't respond either, sir. (Charlie enters) 
KIRK: Mister Spock, you getting any readings on your instruments? 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. There's a Tyger, tyger, burning bright in the forest
of the night. 
KIRK: Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: I'm trying to Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's
Martian red. 
CHARLIE: You're trying to change course, Captain. You can't do that. I
want to get to Colony Five as soon as we can. 
KIRK: Release the transmitter. 
CHARLIE: You don't need all that subspace chatter. 
MCCOY: What's going on here? Spock calls me to the Bridge and goes into
some kind of poetry. 
KIRK: See to her, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary. 
CHARLIE: Very nice, Mister Ears. Oh, I can make him do anything, whirl
around, laugh, anything. 
KIRK: That's enough, Charlie. 
CHARLIE: Don't you think he's funny? I think he's funny. 
KIRK: Leave my crew alone. (Charlie leaves) 
SPOCK: Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down. 
KIRK: I know.
[Corridor]
TINA: Charlie, what's wrong? (he turns her into an
iguana) 
[Rand's quarters]
CHARLIE: I have something for you. (a rose) Pink is
your favourite, isn't it? 
RAND: You don't walk into a room without knocking. 
CHARLIE: Don't ever lock your door on me again, Janice. I love you. 
RAND: I'll lock it when I please. What is it you want, anyway? 
CHARLIE: You. I only want to be nice to you. I can give you anything.
Just, just tell me. 
RAND: (switching on comm.) I want you to get out.
[Bridge]
CHARLIE [OC]: But I only want to be nice to you. 
RAND [OC]: Get out, Charlie. 
KIRK: Spock. 
RAND [OC]: I can't make it any plainer than that.
[Rand's quarters]
CHARLIE: I love you. 
RAND: You don't know what the word means. 
CHARLIE: Then show me. 
RAND: No! 
(Kirk and Spock rush in, Charlie knocks them down.) 
RAND: Charlie! 
(She slaps him, so he makes her disappear.) 
CHARLIE: Why did she do that? I loved her, but she wasn't nice at all.
What you did wasn't nice either, but I still need you, Captain. The
Enterprise isn't quite like the Antares. Running the Antares was easy.
You have to be nice. All right? (gives pain) 
KIRK: Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: My legs. They're broken. 
KIRK: Let him go, too, Charlie. 
CHARLIE: Why? 
KIRK: Because I'm telling you to. Because you need me to run the ship,
and I need him. 
CHARLIE: If you try to hurt me again, I'll make a lot of people go
away. 
KIRK: And what about Yeoman Janice? Is she dead? Gone? Destroyed? 
CHARLIE: I won't tell you. Growing up isn't so much. I'm not a man, and
I can do anything! You can't.
[Corridor]
SPOCK: I'll activate the force field myself. You
can return to your section. 
CHARLIE: He had a mean look. I had to freeze him. I like happy looks.
(enters room) Aren't you coming in? (A forcefield activates in the doorway so
Charlie makes the wall go away and freezes Kirk and Spock.) CHARLIE: That wasn't
nice. You'll be sorry. You wait, you'll see, you'll be sorry you did
that. (unfreezes them) You will.
(He turns a young woman into an old one. Some crew are laughing in a
room.) 
CHARLIE: No. No laughing!
(The shadows freeze, then a woman with no face feels her way around the
corner)
[Bridge]
UHURA: Captain Kirk, my instruments show we're
receiving a message on subspace frequency three, ship-to-ship. I can't
hear it, sir. 
KIRK: Are you creating that message, Charlie, or you're blocking one
that's coming in. 
CHARLIE: It's my game, Captain. You have to find out. Like you said,
that's how the game's played. You can have it now. I've locked on
course for Colony Five again. (leaves) 
KIRK: I've waited long enough. I'm going to take him on. 
MCCOY: You don't have any special immunity. Not anymore. Pushed far
enough, he'd send you off to oblivion, too. 
KIRK: Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Out of the question. 
KIRK: Wait a minute. Does Charlie? Now, wait, Spock, has he done away
with anybody since he took over? 
SPOCK: Not so far as we know. 
KIRK: Maybe he can't. Could be he's overreached himself. It's a big
ship. He's taken full control. If we could tax his power,
turn on every device on the ship, every circuit, every light, all of
it, and while he's fighting that, if I could distract him, maybe you
could
tranquilize him, keep him under until we reach Colony Five. 
MCCOY: Risky, Jim. 
KIRK: If we don't try, Doctor, he'll get rid of us anyway. There's no
choice, gentlemen, none at all. 
CHARLIE: I can make you all go away anytime I want to. 
KIRK: Get out of my chair, Charlie, and get out of it now. 
CHARLIE: I've got your ship, Captain. 
KIRK: Maybe, Charlie, but I don't think you can handle any more. I
think you've reached your limit and can't take on one more thing, but
you're going to have to. 
CHARLIE: I could've sent you away before, but I didn't. 
KIRK: You're going to have to take me on. 
CHARLIE: Don't make me do it now. 
KIRK: You've got my ship, and I want it back. I want my crew back,
whole, if I have to break your neck to do it! (throws him out of
command chair) 
CHARLIE: Don't push me. (gives Kirk pain) Sorry. I'm sorry but. Stop
it. I said stop it! 
SPOCK: Captain, the navigation console is clear now. The ship is
answering the helm. 
UHURA: Sir, something off our starboard bow. The message says they're
from Thasus. 
(Rand reappears) 
CHARLIE: Oh. 
RAND: Captain, how did I? 
KIRK: It's all right, Yeoman. 
SPOCK: Sensors show there something's there, Captain. Deflectors
indicate no solid substance. 
CHARLIE: No! Oh, no, please, don't let them take me. I can't live with
them anymore. You're my friends. You said you were my friends,
remember? When I came aboard! Please, I want to go home. Take me home. 
THASIAN: I have taken my form from centuries ago, so that I may
communicate with you. We did not realise until too late that the boy
had gone, and we are saddened that his escape cost the lives of the
first ship. We could not help them, but we have returned your people
and your ship to you. Everything is as it was. 
CHARLIE: I won't do it again. Please, I'll be good. I won't ever do it
again. I'm sorry about the Antares. I'm sorry! When I came aboard!
Please, I want to go with you. Help me! 
KIRK: The boy belongs with his own kind. 
THASIAN: That would be impossible. 
KIRK: With training, we can teach him to live in our society. If he can
be taught not to use his power 
THASIAN: We gave him the power so he could live. He will use it,
always, and he would destroy you and your kind, or you would be forced
to destroy him to save yourselves. 
KIRK: Is there nothing you can do? 
THASIAN: We offer him life, and we will take care of him. Come,
Charles. 
CHARLIE: Oh, please, don't let them take me. I can't even touch them!
Janice, they can't feel. Not like you! They don't love!
Please, I want to stay. (fades away) 
UHURA: Charlie's back on board the Thasian ship, sir. They signal
they're leaving. 
KIRK: It's all right, Yeoman. It's all over now.

Stardate:
1312.4
Original Airdate: 22 Sep, 1966
 
Captain's log, Star date 1312.4. The impossible has happened. From
directly ahead, we're picking up a recorded distress signal, the call
letters of a vessel which has been missing for over two centuries. Did
another Earth ship once probe out of the galaxy as we intend to do?
What happened to it out there? Is this some warning they've left
behind?
[Briefing room]
SPOCK: Your move, Captain. 
KIRK: We should have intercepted by now. The Bridge said they'd call. 
SPOCK: I'll have you checkmated your next move. 
KIRK: Have I ever mentioned you play a very irritating game of chess,
Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Irritating? Ah, yes. One of your Earth emotions. 
KIRK: Certain you don't know what irritation is? 
SPOCK: The fact one of my ancestors married a human female 
KIRK: Terrible having bad blood like that. 
KELSO [on monitor] Bridge to briefing lounge. Object is now within
tractor beam range. 
KIRK: No visual contact, Mister Kelso? 
KELSO [on monitor]: No, sir. It's too small to be a vessel. It only
reads about one metre in diameter. 
SPOCK: Not large enough even for a lifeboat. 
KELSO [on monitor] Small enough to bring it aboard, sir, if you want to
risk it. 
KIRK: Lock onto it, Mister Kelso.
[Transporter room]
SCOTT: Materialiser ready, sir. 
KIRK: Bring it aboard. Old-style ship recorder that could be ejected
when something threatened the ship. 
SPOCK: More like destroyed the ship in this case. Look at it. Burnt,
pitted. 
KIRK: Let's hope its tapes are intact. We'll feed it through Mister
Spock's computer. 
SCOTT: Yes, sir. It's begun transmitting, sir. 
KIRK: Flash the Bridge. Put all decks on the alert.
[Turbolift]
MITCHELL: Hold it, Jim. 
KIRK: Getting into shape? 
MITCHELL: Yeah, well I figured you weren't on the Bridge. Kelso's voice
sounded a little nervous. Well, uh, you finish the game? 
SPOCK: He played most illogically. His next move should have been the
rook. 
[Bridge]
MITCHELL: Yore relieved, Mister Alden. 
ALDEN: Acknowledged, Mister Mitchell. 
KIRK: Screen on. 
KELSO: Screen on, sir. Approaching galaxy edge, sir. 
KIRK: Neutralise warp, Mister Mitchell. Hold this position. 
MITCHELL: Neutralise warp, sir. 
KIRK: Address intercraft. 
MITCHELL: Intercraft open. 
KIRK: This is the Captain speaking. The object we encountered is a
ship's disaster recorder, apparently ejected from the S.S. Valiant two
hundred years ago. 
SPOCK: The tapes are burnt out. Trying the memory banks. 
KIRK: We hope to learn from the recorder what the Valiant was doing
here and what destroyed the vessel. We'll move out into our probe as
soon as we have those answers. All decks, stand by. 
MITCHELL: Department heads, sir. You wanted everybody on the Bridge
before we left the galaxy.
Jones.
SMITH: The name's Smith, sir. 
SULU: Astro sciences standing by, Captain. 
SCOTT: Engineering division ready, as always. 
PIPER: Life sciences ready, sir. This is Doctor Dehner, who joined the
ship at the Aldebaran colony. 
DEHNER: Psychiatry, Captain. My assignment is to study crew reaction in
emergency conditions. 
SPOCK: Getting something from the recorder now. 
DEHNER: lf there was an emergency, I'd be interested in how that crew
reacted, too. 
MITCHELL: Improving the breed, Doctor? Is that your line? 
DEHNER: I heard that's more your specialty, Commander, line included. 
MITCHELL: (to Kelso) Walking freezer unit. 
SPOCK: Decoding memory banks. I'll try to interpolate. The Valiant had
encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this
direction. 
KIRK: The old impulse engines weren't strong enough. 
SPOCK: Swept past this point, about a half light year out of the
galaxy, they were thrown clear, turned, and headed back into the galaxy
here. I'm not getting it all. The tapes are pretty badly burned. Sounds
like the ship had encountered some unknown force. Now, orders, counter
orders, repeated urgent requests for information from the ship's
computer records for anything concerning ESP in human beings. 
KIRK: Extrasensory perception. Doctor Dehner, how are you on ESP? 
DEHNER: In tests I've taken, my ESP rated rather high. 
KIRK: I'm asking what you know about ESP. 
DEHNER: It is a fact that some people can sense future happenings, read
the backs of playing cards and so on, but the esper capacity is always
quite limited. 
SPOCK: Severe damage. Seven crewmen dead. No, make that six. One
crewman seemed to have recovered. That's when they became interested in
extrasensory perception. More than interested, almost frantic about it.
No, this must be garbled. I get something about destruct. I must have
read it wrong. It sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy
his own ship. 
KIRK: Comments? 
PIPER: The only fact we have for sure is that the S.S. Valiant was
destroyed. 
KIRK: That's probably the best argument to continue the probe. Other
vessels will be heading out here someday and they'll have to know what
they'll be facing. We're leaving the galaxy, Mister Mitchell. Ahead,
warp factor one. 
SPOCK: Force field of some kind. 
MITCHELL: We're coming up on it fast. 
SPOCK: Sensor beam on. 
KELSO: Sensor beam on, sir. 
SPOCK: Deflectors full intensity. 
KELSO: Deflectors full intensity. 
SPOCK: Deflectors say there's something there, sensors say there isn't.
Density negative. Radiation negative. Energy negative. 
KELSO: Whatever it is, contact in twelve seconds. 
KIRK: Gravitation on automatic. (consoles blow up) Emergency stations.
All decks on fire alert. Neutralise controls. Kelso, put it on manual.
Any radiation? Anything? 
SPOCK: Negative! 
KIRK: Helmsmen, take us out of here. (Dehner gets hit by an electric
charge, then Mitchell) Helmsmen! (Kirk takes controls) Lateral power!
(Spock takes over, Enterprise veers away) Take damage reports. 
SPOCK: Damage control reports, all stations! 
CREWMAN [OC]: Gravity control switching to batteries. 
DEHNER: Something hit me, like an electrical charge. 
PIPER: He's alive. Appears to be in shock. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering deck three, can you give damage report? 
CREWMAN 2 [OC]: Sensor beams. Full power on the deflectors. 
SPOCK: Main engines are out, sir. We're on emergency power cells.
Casualties, nine dead. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Gravity is down to point eight. 
CREWMAN 2 [OC]: All decks, this is Bridge Engineering. Due to emergency
conditions. 
KIRK: Gary. Gary, are you all right? 
MITCHELL: I'm a little weak for some reason, Jim, but I feel all right
now. (opens eyes, they're glowing)
Captain's log, Star date 1312.9. Ship's condition,
heading back on impulse power only. Main engines burned out. The ship's
space warp ability gone. Earth bases which were only days away are now
years in the distance. Our overriding question now is what destroyed
the Valiant? They lived through the barrier, just as we have. What
happened to them after that?
[Bridge]
DEHNER: Autopsy report, sir. Each case showed
damage to the body's neural circuit. An area of the brain was burned
out. 
KIRK: And you, are you feeling all right? 
DEHNER: Yes. Mitchell, too, except for his eyes. We're trying to find a
reason for that now, and why, out of our whole crew, only certain
people were affected. 
SPOCK: I think we've found that answer, Doctor. 
KIRK: You mentioned that tests show you have a high degree of
extrasensory perception. So do the records of the others. Gary Mitchell
has the highest esper rating of all. 
DEHNER: lf you're suggesting there's anything dangerous 
SPOCK: Before the Valiant was destroyed, its captain was frantically
searching for ESP information on his crew. 
DEHNER: Espers are simply people with flashes of insight. 
SPOCK: Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects,
cause fires to start spontaneously? 
DEHNER: There's nothing about it that could possibly make a person
dangerous. 
SPOCK: Doctor Dehner is speaking of normal ESP power. 
DEHNER: Perhaps you know of another kind? 
KIRK: Do we know for sure, Doctor, that there isn't another kind?
[Sickbay]
MITCHELL: (without looking) Hello, Jim. Hey, you
look worried. 
KIRK: I've been worried about you ever since that night on Deneb IV. 
MITCHELL: Yeah, she was nova, that one. Not nearly as many
after-effects this time, except for the eyes. They kind of stare back
at me when I'm shaving. 
KIRK: Do you feel any different? 
MITCHELL: Well, in a way, I feel better than I've ever felt before in my
life. Actually seems to have done me some good. 
KIRK: How? 
MITCHELL: Well, I'm getting a chance to read some of that longhair
stuff you like. Hey man, I remember you back at the Academy. A stack of
books with legs. The first thing I ever heard from an upperclassman was,
watch out for Lieutenant Kirk. In his class, you either think or sink. 
KIRK: I wasn't that bad, was I? 
MITCHELL: If I hadn't aimed that little blonde lab technician at you 
KIRK: You what? You planned that? 
MITCHELL: Well, you wanted me to think, didn't you? I outlined her
whole campaign for her. 
KIRK: I almost married her! 
MITCHELL: Better be good to me. I'm getting even better ideas here. 
KIRK: (looks at monitor) You? Spinoza? 
MITCHELL: Once you get into him, he's rather simple though. Childish,
almost. I don't agree with him at all. 
KIRK: Go on. 
MITCHELL: Hey, I'm trying to tell you I feel fine. When do I go back on
duty? 
KIRK: I'm going to ask Doctor Dehner to keep you under observation for
a while. 
MITCHELL: With almost a hundred women on board, you can do better than
that, friend Captain. 
KIRK: Consider it a challenge. 
MITCHELL: That doesn't seem very friendly. (weird voice) Didn't I say you'd better be (normal) good to me? 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: He's reading even faster now than just a few
moments ago. Is that Gary Mitchell, the one you used to know? 
KIRK: Put a twenty four hour watch on the Sickbay. Fullest possible
range of examinations and tests. 
[Sickbay]
PIPER: Perfect, perfect. I've never had a patient
like you, Gary. Even the healthiest are generally off on some
reading. leaves) 
DEHNER: I know you don't particularly like me, Mister Mitchell, but
since I am assigned here, can we make the best of it? 
MITCHELL: I've got nothing against you, Doctor. 
DEHNER: Nor against the walking freezer unit? 
MITCHELL: Well, I, sorry about that. 
DEHNER: Women professionals do tend to overcompensate. Now let's talk
about you. How do you feel? 
MITCHELL: You know, everybody, everybody seems worried that I don't
have some kind of fever or something. Maybe if we could just change
these dials (sends them soaring). Now back to normal, I think. 
DEHNER: How did you do that? 
MITCHELL: I'm not sure, I, I just thought of making it happen, and it
does. It's, hey, er hey watch this, Doc. 
(indicators plummet, Mitchell collapses) 
DEHNER: Stop it. Stop it! You were dead for almost twenty two seconds.
There were no readings at all. 
MITCHELL: Yeah. Oh, boy. You, you know, Doc, there have been other
things too, like going halfway through the ship's library
in hardly a day. Yeah. Oh, what's happening to me? 
DEHNER: Do you remember everything you read that quickly? 
MITCHELL: Yeah. 
DEHNER: On any tape? 
MITCHELL: Sure. Yeah. 
DEHNER: Try this one. 
MITCHELL: Yeah. 
DEHNER: Page three eighty seven. 
MITCHELL: My love has wings. Slender, feathered things with grace in
upswept curve and tapered tip. The Nightingale Woman,
written by Phineas Tarbolde on the Canopius planet back in 1996. It's
funny you picked that one, Doctor. 
DEHNER: Why? 
MITCHELL: That's one of the most passionate love sonnets of the past
couple of centuries. How do you feel, Doctor? 
DEHNER: What? 
MITCHELL: How do you feel? 
DEHNER: I just fell. Nothing happened. 
MITCHELL No? Are you sure? Are you sure? 
KELSO: Er, I was on my coffee break. I thought I'd check up on 
MITCHELL Yeah, that's okay Lee, come on in. Don't let the light in my
eyes bother you, pal. It's all for our, our good-looking lady doctor
here. 
KELSO: Yeah. Sure. 
MITCHELL: So, er, so, how go the repairs? 
KELSO: Well, the main engines are gone, unless we can find some way to
re-energise them. 
MITCHELL: You'd better check the starboard impulse packs. Those points
have about decayed to lead. 
KELSO: Oh, yeah, sure, Mitch. 
MITCHELL: I'm not joking, Lee! You activate those packs, and you'll
blow the whole impulse deck. 
KELSO: I'll, er, I'll get on it right away. I just wanted to stop by
and make sure you were okay. See you later. (leaves) 
MITCHELL: He's a fool. A fool. He'd seen those points and he hadn't
noticed their condition. 
DEHNER: How do you know? 
MITCHELL: The image of what he'd seen was still in his mind.
[Briefing room]
KELSO: Well, it didn't make any sense that he'd
know, but naturally, I checked out the circuit anyway. I don't know
how, but he was right. This point is burned out exactly the way he
described it. 
DEHNER: Sorry I'm late. I became so interested in observing Gary,
Mister Mitchell. 
SPOCK: Our subject is not Gary Mitchell. Our concern is, rather, what
he is mutating into. 
DEHNER: I know those from your planet aren't suppose to have feelings
like we do, Mister Spock, but to talk that way about a man you've
worked next to for years is worse than 
KIRK: That's enough, Doctor. 
DEHNER: I don't think so. I understand you least of all. Gary told me
that you've been friends since he joined the service, that you asked
for him aboard your first command. 
KIRK: It is my duty, whether pleasant or unpleasant, to listen to the
reports, observations, even speculations, on any subject that might
affect the safety of this vessel, and it's my science officer's duty to
see I'm provided with that. Go ahead, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Have you noted evidence of unusual powers? 
DEHNER: He can control certain autonomic reflexes. He reads very fast,
retains more than most of us might consider usual. 
KIRK: Mister Scott, would you repeat what you just told us? 
SCOTT: About an hour ago, the Bridge controls started going crazy.
Levers shifting by themselves, buttons being pushed, instrument
readings changing. 
SPOCK: And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time
it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his
amusement. 
KIRK: Are they right, Doctor? Has he shown abilities of such magnitude?
DEHNER: I saw some such indications. 
KIRK: And you didn't think it worth mentioning? 
DEHNER: No one's been hurt, have they? Don't you understand? A mutated
superior man could also be a wonderful thing. The forerunner of a new
and better kind of human being. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu. 
SULU: If you want the mathematics of this, Mitchell's ability is
increasing geometrically. That is, like having a penny, doubling it
every day. In a month, you'll be a millionaire. 
SPOCK: In less time than that, he will have attained powers we can't
understand and can't cope with. Soon we'll be not only useless to him,
but actually an annoyance. 
KIRK: There'll be no discussion of this with the crew. Thank you.
(everyone else leaves)
SPOCK: We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard, Jim. You heard
the mathematics of it. In a month he'll have as much in common with us
as we'd have with a ship full of white mice. 
KIRK: I need a recommendation, Spock, not vague warnings. 
SPOCK: Recommendation one. There's a planet a few light days away from
here. Delta Vega. It has a lithium cracking station. We may be able to
adapt some of its power packs to our engines. 
KIRK: And if we can't? We'll be trapped in orbit there. We haven't
enough power to blast back out. 
SPOCK: It is the only possible way to get Mitchell off this ship. 
KIRK: If you mean strand Mitchell there, I won't do it. That station is
fully automated. There's not a soul on the whole planet. Even the ore
ships call only once every twenty years. 
SPOCK: Then you have one other choice. Kill Mitchell while you still
can. 
KIRK: Get out of here. 
SPOCK: It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you
still have time. 
KIRK: Will you try for one moment to feel? At least act like you've got
a heart. We're talking about Gary. 
SPOCK: The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he
waited too long to make his decision. I think we've both guessed that. 
KIRK: Set course for Delta Vega.
Star date 1313.1. We're now approaching Delta Vega.
Course set for a standard orbit. This planet, completely uninhabited,
is slightly smaller than Earth. Desolate, but rich in crystal and
minerals. Kelso's task, transport down with a repair party, try to
regenerate the main engines, save the ship. Our task, transport down a
man I've known for fifteen years, and if we're successful, maroon him
there.
[Sickbay]
MITCHELL: I'm thirsty. (cup slides under tap, is
filled, then flies through the air to his hand) It's like a man who has
been blind all of his life, suddenly being given sight. Sometimes I
feel there's nothing I couldn't do, in time. Some people think that
makes me a monster, don't they Jim. 
KIRK: Are you reading all our thoughts, Gary? 
MITCHELL: I can sense mainly worry in you, Jim. Safety of your ship. 
KIRK: What would you do in my place? 
MITCHELL: Probably just what Mister Spock is thinking now. Kill me
while you can. 
(He zaps Kirk and Spock with electric bolts) 
DEHNER: Stop it, Gary! 
MITCHELL: I also know we're orbiting Delta Vega, Jim. I can't let you
force me down there. I may not want to leave this ship, not yet. I may
want another place. I'm not sure yet just what kind of a world I can
use. 
DEHNER: Use? 
MITCHELL: I don't understand it all yet, but if I keep growing, getting
stronger, why, the things I could do, like, like maybe a god could do.
(Kirk knocks him out)
KIRK: I want him unconscious for a while. (Dehner sedates him) 
[Transporter room]
MITCHELL: You fools! Soon I'll squash you like
insects. (Piper re-sedates him) 
KIRK: Energise.
[Planet surface]
KIRK: Can you do it, Lee? 
KELSO: Maybe, if we can bypass the fuel bins without blowing ourselves
up. 
KIRK: Take him. 
DEHNER: There's not a soul on this planet but us?
KIRK: Nobody but us chickens, Doctor.
[Delta Vega Control room]
ALDEN: I think I've got the 203-R set, Lee.
KELSO: Good, Alden. Transport it up with you, will you?
ALDEN: Okay. 
KIRK: The fuel bins, Lee. Could they be detonated from here?
KELSO: A destruct switch? I guess I could wire one up right there.
KIRK: Do it.
SPOCK: He's regaining consciousness.
[Delta Vega Brig]
KIRK: Doctor Piper. I want only one medical officer
here at any one time. The other will monitor him on the dispensary
screen. 
DEHNER: I'd like to stay now, try to talk to him. 
MITCHELL: My friend James Kirk. remember those rodent things on
Dimorus? The poisoned darts they threw? I took one meant for you. 
KIRK: And almost died. I remember. 
MITCHELL: So why be afraid of me now? 
KIRK: You've been testing your ability to take over the Enterprise. In
the transporter room, you said something about us
seeming like insects by comparison, squashing us if we got in your way.
MITCHELL: I was drugged then. 
KIRK: Yes. In the Sickbay, you said if you were in my place, you'd kill
a mutant like yourself. 
MITCHELL: Why don't you kill me then? Mister Spock is right and you're
a fool if you can't see it. 
DEHNER: You don't mean that, Gary. 
MITCHELL: Man cannot survive if a race of true espers is born. In time
you'll understand that. (tests the forcefield) 
KIRK: Gary. Gary, don't! 
MITCHELL: Jim. 
KIRK: His eyes went back to normal. 
SPOCK: Fighting the force field drained his strength, for a while at
least. He could be handled now. 
MITCHELL: I'll just keep getting stronger. You know that, don't you.
[Bridge]
SCOTT: (having put new panel in a bridge station)
It fits like a glove, Captain.
[Delta Vega Control room]
SCOTT [OC]: Oh, did Mister Spock get the phaser
rifle we sent down? 
KIRK: I didn't order any (Spock enters with rifle) Affirmative. Landing
party out. 
SPOCK: He tried to get through the force field again. His eyes changed
back faster. He didn't become as weak. 
KIRK: Doctor Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous. What makes you right
and a trained psychiatrist wrong? 
SPOCK: Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic. In my opinion
we'll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time. 
KELSO: Direct to the power bins. From here you could blow up this whole
valley. 
KIRK: If Mitchell gets out, at your discretion, Lee, if sitting here,
you think you're the last chance, I want you to hit that button.
Captain's log, Star date 1313.3. Note commendations
on Lieutenant Kelso and the engineering staff. In orbit above us,
the engines of the Enterprise are almost fully regenerated. Balance of
the landing party is being transported back up.
Mitchell, whatever he's become, keeps changing, growing stronger by the
minute.
[Delta Vega Brig]
DEHNER: He's been like that for hours now. 
KIRK: Have Doctor Piper meet us in the control room with Kelso. We'll
all transport up together. 
SPOCK: If he should try to stop us 
KIRK: Kelso will be on the destruct button until the last minute. I
think he knows that. 
DEHNER: I'm staying behind with him.
[Delta Vega Control room]
KELSO: Fission chamber three checks out. The
station seems to be running fine. 
SCOTT [OC]: You're a talented thief, Kelso. Everything you sent up
seems to be fitting in place. 
KELSO: I'm kind of proud of the job we've done. We're going to be ready
to transport up (a cable loops over his neck from behind and throttles
him)
[Delta Vega Brig]
KIRK: You're leaving with the ship, Doctor. 
DEHNER: He is not evil. 
KIRK: I gave you an order, Doctor. 
MITCHELL: You should have killed me while you could, James. Command and
compassion is a fool's mixture. (zaps Kirk and Spock then waves away
the forcefield. He leads Dehner into his cell and we see in the mirror
her eyes are like his now)
PIPER: It hit me, too, whatever it was. Kelso is
dead, strangled. At least Spock's alive. 
KIRK: Doctor Dehner? 
PIPER: She went with Mitchell. 
KIRK: Don't give him a pill until after I'm gone. It's my fault
Mitchell got as far as he did. Did you see their direction? 
PIPER: Yes, there was some morning light. They were headed across the
valley, to the left of the pointed peaks. There's flatlands beyond. 
KIRK: When Mister Spock recovers, you'll both transport up immediately
to the Enterprise. 
PIPER: But Captain 
KIRK: If you have not received a signal from me within twelve hours,
you'll proceed at maximum warp to the nearest Earth base
with my recommendation that this entire planet be subjected to a lethal
concentration of neutron radiation. No protest on this, Mark. That's an
order.
[Planet surface]
DEHNER: It would take almost a miracle to survive
here. 
MITCHELL: Then I shall make one. Behold. (creates and oasis with
flowers and a spring) You'll soon share this feeling, Elizabeth. To be
like God, to have the power to make the world anything you want it to
be. 
DEHNER: What's wrong? 
MITCHELL: A visitor. A very foolish man. You'll enjoy being a god,
Elizabeth. Blasphemy? No. Let there be food. Kaferian apples. Whenever
we visited that planet, I always favoured these. Can you hear me,
James? You cannot see me. I'm not there. You follow the right path,
James. You'll come to me soon. 
DEHNER: I can see him in my mind, too. 
MITCHELL: Go to him, Elizabeth, talk to him. Now that you're changing I
want you to see just how unimportant they are.
DEHNER: Yes, it just took a little longer for it to
happen to me. 
KIRK: You must help me Before it goes too far. 
DEHNER: What he's doing is right for him and me. 
KIRK: And for humanity? You're still human 
DEHNER: No, I 
KIRK: At least partly, you are, or you wouldn't be here talking to me. 
DEHNER: Earth is really unimportant. Before long, we'll be where it
would have taken mankind millions of years of learning to reach. 
KIRK: What will Mitchell learn in getting there? Will he know what to
do with his power? Will he acquire the wisdom? 
DEHNER: Please go back while you still can. 
KIRK: Did you hear him joke about compassion? Above all else, a god
needs compassion. Mitchell! Elizabeth. 
DEHNER: What do you know about gods? 
KIRK: Then let's talk about humans, about our frailties. As powerful as
he gets, he'll have all that inside him. 
DEHNER: Go back. 
KIRK: You were a psychiatrist once. You know the ugly, savage things we
all keep buried, that none of us dare expose. But he'll dare. Who's to
stop him? He doesn't need to care. Be a psychiatrist for one minute
longer. What do you see happening to him? What's your prognosis,
Doctor? 
DEHNER: He's coming. 
KIRK: Then watch him. Hang on to being a human for one minute longer. 
MITCHELL: I'm disappointed in you, Elizabeth. (phaser rifle has no
effect on him) I've been contemplating the death of an old friend. He
deserves a decent burial, at least. (a grave appears in the rock, with
a tombstone engraved James R Kirk. A massive boulder on the cliff above
is loosened) 
DEHNER: Stop it, Gary. 
MITCHELL: Morals are for men, not gods. 
KIRK: A god, but still driven by human frailty. Do you like what you
see? 
MITCHELL: Time to pray, Captain. Pray to me. 
KIRK: To you? Not to both of you? 
MITCHELL: Pray that you die easily. 
KIRK: There'll only be one of you in the end. One jealous god. if all
this makes a god, or is it making you something else? 
MITCHELL: Your last chance, Kirk. 
KIRK: Do you like what you see? Absolute power corrupting absolutely.
(Dehner zaps Mitchell, he returns fire, she continues and his eyes
return to normal)
DEHNER: Hurry. You haven't much time. 
(The two men punch and wrestle
until Kirk raises a rock over his head)
KIRK: Gary, forgive me. 
(Mitchell's eyes glow again)
MITCHELL: For a moment, James, but your moment is fading. 
(They both
fall into the grave, but Kirk leaps out first, grabs the rifle and
brings the boulder down to entomb Mitchell)
DEHNER: I'm sorry. You can't know what it's like to be almost a god.
(She dies) 
KIRK: Enterprise from Captain Kirk, come in.
[Bridge]
KIRK: Captain's log, Star date 1313.8. Add to
official losses, Doctor Elizabeth Dehner. Be it noted she gave her life
in performance of her duty. Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell, same
notation. I want his service record to end that way. He didn't ask for
what happened to him. 
SPOCK: I felt for him, too. 
KIRK: I believe there's some hope for you after all, Mister Spock.

Stardate:
1704.2
Original Airdate: 29 Sep, 1966
 Captain's
Log. Our position, orbiting Psi 2000, an ancient world, now a frozen
wasteland, about to rip apart in its death throes. Our mission, pick up
a scientific party below, observe the disintegration of the planet.
[Psi 2000 control room]
SPOCK: Check out the life-support systems. 
TORMOLEN: Right, sir. All life systems were off, sir.
SPOCK: Someone strangled this woman.
TORMOLEN The other four are back there.
SPOCK: Dead?
TORMOLEN: Right, sir.
SPOCK: Engineer at his post?
TORMOLEN He's frozen there like he didn't care.
SPOCK: The rest?
TORMOLEN: Well, better look for yourself, Mister Spock. One man was
taking a shower fully clothed. (they split up, he takes off his glove
to scratch his nose then puts it on the console. Something orange jumps
onto his skin. Feeling the cold he puts the glove back on)
SPOCK: Be certain we expose ourselves to nothing. Spock here. Do you
read, Enterprise? 
KIRK [OC]: Kirk, affirmative.
SPOCK: All station personnel are dead.
KIRK [OC]: What caused it?
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. It's like nothing we've dealt with before.
Captain's Log: Stardate 1704.2. The science party
we were to have picked up has been found dead. Life support systems had
been turned off. Station personnel, frozen to death. Conditions highly
unusual. Meanwhile, we remain in orbit to complete our mission, close
scientific measurement of the break-up of this planet.
[Transporter room]
SPOCK: You received my signal, Mister Scott.
SCOTT: Yes, sir. Decontaminate.
[Bridge]
KIRK: Captain here. 
[Transporter room]
SCOTT: Spock and Tormolen aboard, sir.
[Bridge]
SCOTT [OC]: We're holding them in the chamber for
decontamination.
KIRK: Better have Medicine look them over too. Tell Mister Spock I'll
meet him there in ten minutes. Kirk out.
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: You're fine, Joe. Up and out of there.
Mister Spock? Your pulse is two hundred and forty two, your blood
pressure is practically nonexistent, assuming you call that green stuff
in your veins blood.
SPOCK: The readings are perfectly normal for me, Doctor, thank you, and
as for my anatomy being different from yours, I am delighted. Captain.
KIRK: How are they?
MCCOY: They're fine, Jim. 
TORMOLEN: Terrible, Captain. It was terrible. They were just sitting,
like they didn't care. Whatever was happening, they didn't care. I keep
wondering
KIRK: You keep wondering if man was meant to be out here. You keep
wondering, you keep signing on. Any guesses, Mister Spock? Any idea of
what happened down there?
SPOCK: I wish I could say, Captain. The circumstances were quite
bizarre, however our record tapes may show us something.
TORMOLEN: Six dead. Six people dead.
KIRK: You'd better get some rest.
TORMOLEN: Yes, sir.
KIRK: Set up those tapes, Mister Spock. We'll see if the answers are
there. (leaves with Spock)
CHAPEL: The lab status report, Doctor.
MCCOY: Oh, thank you, Christine.
[Briefing room]
SPOCK: Next tape, please.
RAND: Spectro-analysis tape, sir.
SPOCK: Thank you.
KIRK: Almost as though they were irrational, drugged. An engineer
sitting there, apparently oblivious to everything. A woman strangled. A
crewman with a phaser pistol in his hand.
SPOCK: He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery.
KIRK: And a fully clothed man frozen to death in a shower. If the image
wasn't so ugly, it would be laughable. Not even a theory, gentlemen?
MCCOY: Definitely not drugs or intoxication. The bio-analysis on the
tapes prove that conclusively.
SPOCK: It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but
it would have to be caused by something. Our spectro-readings showed no
contamination, no unusual elements present.
SCOTT: Or at least none your tricorders could register.
SPOCK: Instruments register only those things they're designed to
register. Space still contains infinite unknowns.
KIRK: Earth Science needs the closest possible measurement of the
breakup of this planet. To do this, we need the Enterprise
in a critically tight orbit. Question. Could what happened down there
to those people create any unusual danger to this vessel and crew?
SPOCK: We will need top efficiency, Captain. It'll be a tricky orbit.
When the planet begins to go, there may be drastic changes in gravity,
mass, magnetic field.
KIRK: The purpose of a briefing, gentlemen, is to get me answers based
on your abilities and experience. In a critical orbit, there's no time
for surprise. 
SCOTT: Unless you people on the Bridge start taking showers with your
clothes on, my engines can pull us out of anything. We'll be warping
out of orbit within a half second of getting your command.
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain.
KIRK: Kirk here.
UHURA [OC]: Scanners report sudden four degree shift in planet magnetic
field. A change in mass also, sir.
SPOCK: It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts.
KIRK: On our way, Lieutenant. I'll hold you to that half second,
Scotty.
[Rec room]
SULU: Foil. It's a rapier. A thin sword.
RILEY: All right. So what do you do with it?
SULU: What do you mean, what do you do with it?
RILEY: Self-defence? Mayhem? Shish kebab?
SULU: You practice.
RILEY: For what?
SULU: Hi, Joey.
RILEY: Last week it was botany he was trying to get me interested in. I
was supposed to be collecting leaves, plant specimens.
SULU: Your attitude is all wrong. Fencing tones the muscle, sharpens
the eye, improves the posture. You tell him, Joey.
Explain to him. Hey, Joey. You feeling all right?
TORMOLEN: Get off me! You don't rank me and you don't have pointed
ears, so just get off my neck!
SULU: What's with him?
TORMOLEN: Nothing!
UHURA [OC]: Attention. Engine room on standby alert. All duty personnel
to the Bridge. Acknowledge.
SULU: You sure you're all right now, Joe? We've got to leave.
TORMOLEN: We're all a bunch of hypocrites. Sticking our noses into
something that we've got no business. What are we doing out here,
anyway?
SULU: Take it easy, Joe.
TORMOLEN: We bring pain and trouble with us, leave men and women stuck
out on freezing planets until they die. What are we doing out here in
space? Good? What good? We're polluting it, destroying it. We've got no
business being out here. No business.
RILEY: Take it easy, Joe.
SULU: Now calm down.
TORMOLEN: If a man was supposed to fly, he'd have wings. If he was
supposed to be out in space, he wouldn't need air to breathe, wouldn't
need life-support systems to keep him from freezing to death.
RILEY: Hey, Joey, put the knife down, huh?
SULU: You're all steamed up, Joe.
TORMOLEN: We don't belong here. It's not ours. Not ours. Destroying and
watching. We don't belong. I don't belong. Six people died down there.
Why do I deserve to live?
SULU: What are you doing, Joe?
RILEY: Hey, Joey, put the knife down. (grabs his arm) Don't be a fool.
TORMOLEN: Let go!
RILEY: You're just getting in a sweat about (three men struggle) Let me
have the knife!
SULU: Joey, don't be a fool.
TORMOLEN: Let me go.
RILEY: Joey, give me the knife. (they fall to the floor, Tormolen gets
stabbed in the stomach) Emergency! Rec room, area three nine. We need
medics!
Captain's Log, supplemental. Our orbit tightening.
Our need for efficiency, critical. But unknown to us, a totally new and
unusual disease has been brought aboard.
[Bridge]
RILEY: Relative gravity increasing, sir.
KIRK: Compensate, Mister Riley.
RILEY: Yes, sir.
SULU: Magnetic field continuing to shift, sir. Planet continuing to
shrink in mass.
KIRK: Mister Spock?
SPOCK: All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain.
RILEY: Orbit steady now, sir.
SPOCK: Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected.
A valuable study. We may be seeing Earth's distant future. Before its
sun went dark, this planet was remarkably similar to yours.
SULU: Helm answering nicely, Captain.
KIRK: Good.
UHURA: Communications status, Captain.
KIRK: Tormolen's record?
SPOCK: Psychiatric file, personality quotients. 
KIRK: Was he trying to kill himself?
SPOCK: It's doubtful he meant to. He was confused, self-tortured.
KIRK: Doesn't sound like the man I know.
SPOCK: His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high. What
puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force.
[Sickbay]
CHAPEL: His breathing rate is dropping, Doctor.
MCCOY: Compensate with the respirator. Stand by to close. Closing.
[Bridge]
KIRK: What is it?
SULU: Relative gravity increase, sir. Like the planet reached out and
yanked at us.
KIRK: Compensate. (adjusts Riley's controls) Compensate.
RILEY: Orbit steady now, sir. May be a little nervous, I guess.
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: This shouldn't be happening. This man should
be getting stronger. You sure the respirator's functioning properly? 
CHAPEL: Yes, Doctor.
MCCOY: Why is this man dying? Hypo.
CHAPEL: He's dead, Doctor.
MCCOY: The wounds were not that severe.
[Bridge]
MCCOY [OC]: This is McCoy. Captain Kirk to Sickbay.
KIRK: Uhura, monitor communications. Tell McCoy I'll be there when I
can.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: Planet breakup is imminent, Captain. Shrinking in size at an
increasing rate. As the planet continues to shrink in size, its surface
moves away from us. 
KIRK: Forcing us to spiral down to maintain the same distance from it.
SPOCK: Exactly. We must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden
change.
KIRK: Engine room from Bridge.
SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, Captain.
KIRK: Tie into the helm, Scotty. If we should call for power, we'll
want it fast.
SCOTT [OC]: No problem, sir. You'll have it.
SPOCK: Rate of compaction seems constant.
KIRK: Then I'll go see what the good doctor wants. Keep me informed of
any change, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Acknowledged.
SULU: Don't know if it's this planet or what happened with Joe. I'm
sweating like a bridegroom.
RILEY: Yeah, me too.
SULU: Hey, why don't you come down to the gym with me, Kevin m'lad?
RILEY: Now?
SULU: Why not? Light workout will take the edge off.
RILEY: Sulu, what about. Hey, Sulu, don't be a fool!
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: Intestinal damage wasn't that severe. I got
to him in plenty of time. That man should still be alive. The only
reason he died, Jim, is he didn't want to live. He gave up.
KIRK: That's a supposition, Doctor, not a fact.
MCCOY: Well, that may be. Maybe. I've lost patients before, but not
like that. Not Joe's kind. That kind of man doesn't give up.
KIRK: Coincidence? Maybe. 
MCCOY: You mean that Joe was down on the planet surface and you're
gonna ask me if it's connected.
KIRK: That's exactly what I was going to ask.
MCCOY: Jim, he was decontaminated. He's been medically checked. We've
run every test we know for everything we know.
KIRK: That's not good enough.
MCCOY: Well, we're doing everything that's possible.
KIRK: Bones, I want the impossible checked out too.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station?
RILEY: Magnetic pull compensated for, sir. Orbit steady.
SPOCK: Take over here, Rand. (a male, not Janice)
RAND: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu?
RILEY: Have no fear, O'Riley's here. One Irishman is worth ten thousand
of you
SPOCK: You're relieved, Mister Riley. Lieutenant Uhura, take over this
station.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
RILEY: Now that's what I like. Let the women work too. Universal
suffrage.
SPOCK: Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley.
RILEY: Sickbay? Exactly where I was heading, sir.
SPOCK: Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he
arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge.
[Sickbay]
RILEY: Where's Joe?
CHAPEL: Well.
RILEY: He died, didn't he.
CHAPEL: Yes.
RILEY: You know something? You have such lovely eyes, pretty lady.
(touches her face)
CHAPEL: I know he was a friend of yours. This must be a terrible shock.
RILEY: You know what Joe's mistake was? He wasn't born an Irishman.
[Corridor]
SULU: (brandishing foil) Richelieu, beware! Stand.
No farther. No escape for you. You either leave this bois bloodied, or
with my blood on your swords. Cowards!
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura.
BRENT: Yes, sir.
KIRK: What were their symptoms?
SPOCK: Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed
rather pleased with himself, as if he were
KIRK: Irrational, or drugged.
SPOCK: Precisely.
KIRK: Security, Lieutenant Uhura.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
KIRK: Both Sulu and Riley, locate and confine. I want every crewman who
comes in contact with them medically checked.
UHURA: Sir, level two, corridor three reports a disturbance. Mister
Sulu chasing crewmen with a sword.
KIRK: Put Security on it.
SPOCK: Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden
personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies
himself a descendant of
Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your
18th century.
KIRK: Present condition of Psi 2000.
SPOCK: Gravity pull increasing. We've shifted to two percent and should
stabilise our position.
KIRK: Helmsman, stabilise position.
BRENT: Helm is not answering to control.
KIRK: Warp us out of here.
BRENT: No response from engines, sir.
KIRK: Impulse power then. Blast us out of this orbit.
BRENT: Impulse engines also dead, sir.
SPOCK: Engine room, we need power!
KIRK: Mister Scott, acknowledge. Our controls are dead. Take her.
SULU: Richelieu, at last.
KIRK: Sulu, put that (discovers that the point is sharp) put that thing
away.
SULU: For honour, Queen, and France! (lunges)
UHURA: Sulu.
SULU: Ah.
UHURA: Sulu, give me that.
SULU: I'll protect you, fair maiden.
UHURA: Sorry, neither.
SULU: Foul Richelieu. (distracted by Uhura's escape, Kirk is able to
grab Sulu and Spock does a neck-pinch)
KIRK: I'd like you to teach me that sometime.
SPOCK: Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay.
KIRK: Scotty, we need power. Engine room, acknowledge!
RILEY [OC]: You rang, sir?
KIRK: Who's this?
[Engineering]
RILEY: This is Captain Kevin Thomas Riley of the
starship Enterprise.
[Bridge]
RILEY [OC]: And who is this?
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. Get out of the engine room, navigator.
Where's Mister Scott?
RILEY [OC]: I've relieved Mister Scott of his duties. Now, attention,
cooks. This is your captain speaking.
I would like double portions of ice cream for the entire crew.
KIRK: Clear that tube, will you?
UHURA: Yes, sir.
RILEY [OC]: And now, your captain will render an ancient Irish
favourite. (sings) I'll take you home again Kathleen
SPOCK: Captain. At our present rate of descent, we have less than
twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere.
KIRK: And burn up. I know, Mister Spock.
RILEY [OC]: Wild and wide to where your heart 
Captain's Log, stardate 1704.4. Ship out of
control, spiraling down towards planet Psi 2000. We have nineteen
minutes of life left without engine power or helm control.
[Corridor outside Engineering]
KIRK: How did Riley get in there?
SCOTT: He ran in, said you wanted us on the Bridge.
KIRK: He's cut off both helm and power.
SCOTT: And he shut the door behind us and locked off the mechanism.
KIRK: Can't you get to the auxiliary?
SCOTT: I can't. He's hooked everything through the main panel in there.
Get up to my office and pull the plans for this bulkhead. The only way
to get that door open is to cut through these wall circuits here.
[Engineering]
RILEY: (singing) The roses all have left your
cheeks. I've watched them fade away and die 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Status reports, all sections.
UHURA: Mister Spock, a fight in the aft wardroom. Security reports
incidents among the crewmen are increasing.
SPOCK: Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections.
UHURA: All decks, alert system B two. Repeat, go to alert condition
Baker two. Seal off all main sections. Stand by.
SPOCK: We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread
of whatever this is.
KIRK: Continue the alert, Lieutenant.
UHURA: I can't, sir. He's cut off the alert channels.
[Engineering]
RILEY: Lieutenant Uhura, 
[Bridge]
RILEY [OC]: You've interrupted my song. I'm sorry,
but there'll be no ice cream for you tonight.
KIRK: Cut him off.
UHURA: I can't, sir. There's no way to do it.
RILEY [OC]: Attention, crew. This is Captain Riley. There will be a
formal dance in the bowling alley at nineteen hundred hours tonight.
SPOCK: No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can
override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir.
(ship is jolted severely)
MCCOY: Sickbay to Bridge.
KIRK: Can you tie me in to the Sickbay?
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: I'm getting you, Jim. Look, can you keep
this beast level? I've got Sulu
tranquillized and we're running tests on him.
[Bridge]
MCCOY [OC]: So far there's nothing unusual in his
bloodstream. Body functions seem normal.
KIRK: Riley's the immediate problem, Doctor. Is there any way, anything
you can do to snap him out of it?
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: Negative, until I can get a little farther
on these tests.
[Bridge]
RILEY [OC]: This is Captain Riley. Crew, I have
some additional orders.
[Engineering]
RILEY: In the future, all female crew members will
wear their hair loosely, about their shoulders.
[Bridge]
RILEY [OC]: And use restraint in putting on your
makeup. Women, women should not look made up. And now, crew, I will
render Kathleen one more time!
KIRK: Please, not again.
[Engineering]
RILEY: (singing) I'll take you home again, Kathleen
(meanwhile, Scott is working in a Jefferies tube) I've watched them
fade away and die.
[Corridor]
 SCOTT: I've set the jumpers up there. Stand by
'til I give you a signal.
[Engineering]
RILEY: And tears bedim your loving eyes. Oh, 
[Corridor outside Engineering]
RILEY [OC]: I will take you home Kathleen.
SCOTT: Engineering to Bridge. Try your helm. You'll have enough power
to keep her stabilised. Here, let's have a look at that.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Sixteen minutes left, Captain. We've
stabilised, but still spiraling down.
UHURA: Emergency signal, Captain. Both decks four and five. Fights and
disorders.
KIRK: Get me Sickbay.
UHURA: I have no intercom for Sickbay. He keeps switching channels on
me.
KIRK: See what you can do to help Doctor McCoy. Better check Scotty
first. Move him faster. He's got to get through that bulkhead.
[Corridor]
SPOCK: Crewman, report to the lab!
MOODY: (singing) I'll take you home again Janice 
SPOCK: What's going on?
RAND: Mister Spock, I'm trying to get to the Bridge and this crewman
won't let me by.
SPOCK: Crewman, stand aside.
MOODY: Oh, yes, sir. I'll take you home again, Janice
RAND: Spock!
[Corridor outside Engineering]
SPOCK: Message from the captain.
SCOTT: Tell him I'm doing my best. If I cut through the wrong circuits
SPOCK: We have fourteen minutes left.
SCOTT: Even if we were under a full-scale attack I couldn't move any
faster, not and maintain a safety factor.
SPOCK: At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll
take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a
safety factor.
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: Biopsy lab. Biopsy, where's my report?
Biopsy, come in! Harrison, where's my report? I'm going to the lab.
CHAPEL: Sir?
MCCOY: Yes?
CHAPEL: The tranquillizer's wearing off.
MCCOY: Oh, good. I'll need him conscious now. Continue to examine him
on circuits K one and three.
CHAPEL: Of course, Doctor.
[Bridge]
KIRK: Get him out of here.
RAND: I would have gotten here sooner, sir but Crewman Moody stopped me
in the hallway.
KIRK: Take the helm.
RAND: Sir?
KIRK: Take the helm!
RAND: Yes, sir.
RILEY [OC]: Kathleen. And now, crew, one more time!
KIRK: At least try cutting him off!
UHURA: Sir, if I could cut him off, don't you think I
RILEY [OC]: I'll take you home again Kathleen 
UHURA: Yes, sir. I'll keep trying.
KIRK: Sorry.
RILEY [OC]: Across the ocean wild and wide 
KIRK: Scotty.
SCOTT [OC]: Engine room.
KIRK: We've got twelve minutes left. It'll take at least two or three
of them to get the engines up to power now.
SCOTT [OC]: Then we'll make it, sir, if all goes right.
KIRK: Call me when you've cut through. I want to be there. Kirk out.
[Sickbay]
SPOCK: Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy?
CHAPEL: He's gone to the lab.
SPOCK: Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab!
CHAPEL: Mister Spock.
SPOCK: What is it, Nurse?
CHAPEL: Mister Spock, (takes his hand) the men from Vulcan treat their
women strangely. At least, people say that, but you're part human too.
I know you don't, you couldn't, hurt me, would you? I'm in love with
you, Mister Spock. You, the human Mister Spock, the Vulcan Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Nurse, you should
CHAPEL: Christine, please. I see things, how honest you are. I know how
you feel. You hide it, but you do have feeling. Oh, how we must hurt
you, torture you.
SPOCK: I'm in control of my emotions.
CHAPEL: The others believe that. I don't. I love you. I don't know why,
but I love you. I do love you just as you are. Oh, I love you.
SPOCK: I'm sorry.
UHURA [OC]: Captain is en route to Engineering, Mister Spock. Can you
take the bridge? Acknowledge.
SPOCK: I am sorry.
CHAPEL: Christine.
SPOCK: Christine.
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Sickbay. Is Mister Spock there?
[Corridor]
UHURA [OC]: Mister Spock, would you please
acknowledge? (Spock is struggling to keep his control)
[Corridor outside Engineering]
RILEY [OC]: I will take you home Kathleen 
SCOTT: Almost ready, sir.
RILEY [OC]: To where your heart will feel no pain. When the fields are
fresh and green. I'll take you to your home
SCOTT: - Ready, sir.
KIRK: (to Security) Follow me through. Put your phasers on stun. Don't
fire unless he's armed. Go.
[Engineering]
RILEY: I'll take. No dance tonight.
KIRK: Get him out of here.
[Briefing room]
SPOCK: (close to tears) I'm in control of my
emotions. Control of my emotions. I am an officer. An officer. My duty.
My duty is, is. My duty is to, to. Too late. I'm sorry. To. Two, four,
six. Six. Six times six.
[Engineering]
KIRK: Scotty, we haven't got much time left.
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain.
KIRK: Kirk here.
UHURA [OC]: Entering planet's outer atmosphere, sir.
SCOTT: Captain.
KIRK: What is it?
SCOTT: He's turned the engines off. Completely cold. It will take
thirty minutes to regenerate them.
UHURA [OC]: Ship's outer skin is beginning to heat, Captain. Orbit plot
shows we have about eight minutes left.
KIRK: Scotty!
SCOTT: I can't change the laws of physics. I've got to have thirty
minutes.
Captain's Log, supplemental. The Enterprise,
spiraling down out of control. Ship's outer skin heating rapidly due to
friction with planet atmosphere. 
SCOTT: Maybe twenty two, twenty three minutes.
KIRK: Scotty, we've got six.
SCOTT: Captain, you can't mix matter and antimatter cold. We'd go up in
the biggest explosion since
KIRK: We can balance our engines into a controlled implosion.
SCOTT: That's only a theory. It's never been done.
KIRK: Bridge, have you found Mister Spock yet?
SCOTT: If you wanted to chance odds of ten thousand to one, maybe,
assuming we had a row of computers working weeks on the right formula.
UHURA: Mister Spock is not on the Bridge, Captain.
[Bridge]
SULU: (waking up screaming) I was on the Bridge.
Hey Doc, what am I doing here?
MCCOY: McCoy to Bio. We've isolated it. Start preparing serum.
HARRISON [OC]: What, Doctor?
MCCOY: It's water. Somehow on this planet, water's changed to a complex
chain of molecules.
HARRISON [OC]: What's that, Doctor?
MCCOY: That's how we missed it. It passed from man to man through
perspiration. Once in the bloodstream, it acts like alcohol, depresses
the centres of judgment, self-control. Now get someone to the lab. Tell
them the serum works, and start preparing more.
SULU: Doc, will you let me out of here? I'm all right.
MCCOY: Release him.
[Briefing room]
SCOTT [OC]: Engineers, man your stations. Engine
rooms, report. Cycling station, report. This will be an emergency
restart of engines.
KIRK: Where have you been? What happened?
SPOCK: My mother. I could never tell her I loved her.
KIRK: We've got four minutes, maybe five.
SPOCK: An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad
taste.
KIRK: We've got to risk a full-power start. The engines were shut off.
No time to regenerate them. Do you hear me? We've got to risk a
full-power start!
SPOCK: I respected my father, our customs. I was ashamed of my Earth
blood. (Kirk slaps him) Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm
ashamed.
KIRK: (hitting him repeatedly) You've got to hear me! We need a
formula. We've got to risk implosion!
SPOCK: t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole
lifetime learning to hide my feelings. (finally hits Kirk back)
KIRK: We've got to risk implosion. It's our only chance.
SPOCK: It's never been done.
KIRK: Don't tell me that again, Science Officer! It's a theory. It's
possible. We may go up into the biggest ball of fire since the last sun
in these parts exploded, but we've got to take that one in ten thousand
chance!
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain. Engineer asked, did you find
KIRK: Yes, I found Mister Spock! I'm talking to Mister Spock, do you
understand?
UHURA: Yes, sir. Three and a half minutes left, Captain.
KIRK: I've got it, the disease. Love. You're better off without it, and
I'm better off without mine. This vessel, I give, she takes. She won't
permit me my life. I've got to live hers.
SPOCK: Jim.
KIRK: I have a beautiful yeoman. Have you noticed her, Mister Spock?
You're allowed to notice her. The Captain's not permitted
SPOCK: Jim, there is an intermix formula.
KIRK: Now I know why it's called she.
SPOCK: It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between
time and antimatter.
KIRK: Flesh woman to touch, to hold. A beach to walk on. A few days, no
braid on my shoulder.
SCOTT: Captain.
KIRK: Scotty, help.
SPOCK: Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge.
UHURA [OC]: Entering upper stratosphere, Captain. Skin temperature now
twenty one hundred seventy degrees.
KIRK: I've got to hang on. Tell them. Clear the corridors, the turbo
lift. Hurry. (Scott and Spock leave) Never lose you.
Never.
[Turbolift]
KIRK: Bridge.
[Bridge]
(McCoy gives Kirk a hypo as he leaves the
turbolift) 
KIRK: Engine room. We're set. Hyperbolic course.
BRENT: Direction, sir?
KIRK: Direction. Direction. It doesn't matter. The way we came.
SULU: Course laid in, sir.
[Engineering]
SPOCK: Fuel temperature.
SCOTT: Level.
[Bridge]
KIRK: (gazing at Janice) No beach to walk on.
RAND: Sir?
[Engineering]
SPOCK: Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees.
SCOTT: That'll take four minutes.
SPOCK: We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready.
[Bridge]
KIRK: Engage. 
SPOCK: Are you all right, Jim?
KIRK: Are you? (Spock nods)
MCCOY: We found a cure. We're over that part of it. 
SPOCK: Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded.
SULU: Captain, my velocity gauge is off the scale.
SPOCK: Engine power went off the scale as well. We're now travelling
faster than is possible for normal space.
KIRK: Checked elapsed time, Mister Sulu.
SULU: My chronometer's running backwards, sir.
KIRK: Time warp. We're going backward in time. Helm, begin reversing
power. Slowly.
SULU: Helm answering, sir. Power reversing.
SPOCK: We're back to normal time, Captain.
KIRK: Engines ahead. Warp one.
SULU: Warp one, sir.
KIRK: Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Yes, sir.
KIRK: The time warp. What did it do to us?
SPOCK: We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days
ago, Captain. We have three days to live over again. 
KIRK: Not those last three days.
SPOCK: This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the
formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era.
KIRK: We may risk it someday, Mister Spock. Resume course to our next
destination, Mister Sulu.
SULU: Course laid in, sir.
KIRK: Steady as she goes.

surface]
KIRK: That should make a good specimen. 
SULU: (holding pink animal with a horn) Temperature's starting to drop.
KIRK: Yeah. At night it gets down to a hundred and twenty degrees below
zero. 
SULU: That's nippy. 
FISHER: Hey! 
KIRK: What happened? 
FISHER: I fell off that bank, sir. Cut my hand. 
KIRK: Let's see it. Get back to the ship. Report to the Sickbay. 
FISHER: Yes, sir. Geological Technician Fisher. Ready to beam up. 
[Transporter room]
SCOTT: Right. Locked onto you. Energise. Coadjutor
engagement. 
WILSON: What happened? 
FISHER: I took a flop. 
WILSON: Onto what? 
FISHER: I don't know. Some kind of yellow ore. 
SCOTT: Magnetic. Decontaminate that uniform. 
FISHER: Yes, sir. (;eaves) 
SCOTT: That acted like a burnout. 
KIRK [OC]: Captain Kirk ready to beam up. 
SCOTT: Just one moment, Captain. It checks out okay now. You better go
get a synchronic meter so we can double-check. 
WILSON: Yes sir. 
SCOTT: All right, Captain. Locked onto you. (Kirk stumbles as he leaves
the platform) Are you all right, Captain? 
KIRK: Yes, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy. 
SCOTT: Let me give you a hand. 
KIRK: I can't get through there. Nothing serious. Don't leave the
transporter room unattended. 
SCOTT: Wilson will be right back, sir. 
(both leave, and another Kirk materialises on the pad) 
Captain's Log, stardate 1672.1. Specimen-gathering
mission on planet Alpha 177. Unknown to any of us during this time, a
duplicate of me, some strange alter ego, had been created by the
transporter malfunction.
[Transporter room]
WILSON: Captain? Are you all right, sir? Can I give
you a hand, sir? Captain? 
[Corridor]
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to all decks. Section duty
officers, check communication lines. 
KIRK: Thank you. 
SCOTT: It might profit you to let Doctor McCoy give you the once-over. 
KIRK: All right, Engineer, I'll have my engines looked to.
[Kirk's quarters]
RAND: Ship's manifests, sir. I think they're in
order now. 
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman. 
RAND: I've checked 
KIRK: That's all. 
RAND: Yes, sir. (leaves Kirk to lie down on bed)
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: You picked a good day, Fisher. Business has
been lousy. What'd you do, take a fall on purpose so you could get a
little vacation? 
KIRK: Saurian brandy. 
Back to duty status, Fisher. I have no sympathy for clumsiness. 
FISHER: No, sir. The hand's much better, sir. (leaves) 
MCCOY: What can I do for you, Jim? 
KIRK: (grabbing him by the neck) I said, give me the brandy! (leaves
with bottle and goes to Rand's quarters) 
[Kirk's quarters] 
KIRK: Yeah. 
SPOCK [OC]: Mister Spock. 
KIRK: Come in. Yes, Mister Spock, what is it? 
SPOCK: Is there something I can do for you, Captain? 
KIRK: Like what? 
SPOCK: Well, Doctor McCoy seemed to think I should check on you. 
KIRK: That's nice. Come on, Spock, I know that look. What is it? 
SPOCK: Well, our good doctor said that you were acting like a wild man,
demanded brandy. 
KIRK: Our good doctor's been putting you on again. 
SPOCK: Hmm. Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion Captain,
I'll get back to my work. 
KIRK: I'll tell him you were properly annoyed. 
SPOCK: Captain.
[Transporter room]
KIRK: What is it, Scotty? 
SCOTT: Transporter breakdown. Continue circuit testing. We beamed up
this animal and, well, look for yourself. It's in this specimen case.
(opens lid to reveal angry pink animal) 
KIRK: Yes? 
SCOTT: A few seconds after they sent this one up through the
transporter, that duplicate appeared. Except it's not a duplicate, it's
an opposite. Two of the same animal, but different. One gentle, this.
One mean and fierce, that. Some kind of savage, ferocious opposite.
Captain, we don't dare send Mister Sulu and the landing party up. If
this should happen to a man. 
KIRK: Oh, my.
[Rand's quarters]
RAND: Oh! Captain, you startled me. Is there
something that you? Can I help you, Captain? 
KIRK: Jim will do here, Janice. 
RAND: Oh. 
KIRK: You're too beautiful to ignore. Too much woman. We've both been
pretending too long. (grabs her) Stop pretending. Let's stop
pretending. Come here, Janice. Don't fight me. Don't fight me, Janice.
(kisses her) 
RAND: Captain! 
KIRK: Just a minute, Janice. Just a minute! (forces her onto the floor,
she scratches his face and gets away to the door which opens just as
Fisher is passing by) 
RAND: Call Mister Spock! Call Mister Spock! 
[Corridor]
FISHER: Geological Technician Fisher. Deck twelve,
section (Kirk grabs him and hits him, hard)
[Kirk's quarters]
KIRK: Me? My yeoman said that? I've been resting
here since you left me. Alone, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy reports that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay
and left with it. I found this bottle in Yeoman Rand's quarters. 
KIRK: Not true. I haven't been to the Sickbay. Let's find out what's
going on.
[Turbolift]
KIRK: Sickbay. (just missing the other Kirk nursing
grazed knuckles, who goes into his quarters)
[Sickbay]
RAND: Then he kissed me and he said that we, that
he was the Captain and he could order me. I didn't know what to do.
When you mentioned the feelings we'd been hiding, and you started
talking about us. 
KIRK: Us? 
RAND: Well, he is the captain. I couldn't just. You started hurting me.
I had to fight you, and scratch your face. 
KIRK: Yeoman, look at me. Look at me, look at my face. Are there any
scratches? 
RAND: I was sure I scratched you. I was frightened. Maybe 
KIRK: Yeoman. I was in my room. It wasn't me. 
RAND: Sir, Fisher saw you, too. 
KIRK: Fisher saw? 
RAND: If it hadn't been. I can understand. I don't want to get you into
trouble. I wouldn't have even mentioned it! 
KIRK: It wasn't me! 
FISHER: It was you, sir. 
KIRK: Do you know what you're saying? 
FISHER: Yes, I know what I'm saying. 
MCCOY: Back to that bed, bucko. Come on, let's go. 
SPOCK: You can go now, Yeoman. (Rand leaves) There's only one logical
answer. We have an impostor aboard.
Captain's Log, stardate 1672.9. On the planet's
surface, temperatures are beginning to drop, our landing party there in
growing jeopardy. Due to the malfunction of the ship's transporter, an
unexplained duplicate of myself definitely exists.
[Transporter room]
KIRK: How did all this happen? 
SCOTT: I don't know sir, but when Fisher came up, his suit was covered
with a soft yellow ore that had highly unusual properties. It may have
caused an overload. Can't tell, not yet. 
KIRK: Does the transporter work at all? 
SCOTT: Yes sir, but we don't dare bring up the landing party. It might
be duplicated like this animal. 
KIRK: How long will it take you to find the trouble? 
SCOTT: Can't say, sir. 
KIRK: We just can't leave those four men down there. It's getting dark.
They'll die. The surface temperature of that planet goes down to a
hundred and twenty degrees below zero at night. 
SCOTT: We're doing everything we can, sir. 
KIRK: Yes, I know, Scotty. 
SPOCK: About your double, Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, er, yes, we'll have to find him. Search parties, Mister
Spock. Organise search parties. 
SPOCK: We can't take a chance on killing it. We have no previous
experience, no way of knowing what would happen to you. 
KIRK: Yes, that's right. We don't know, but the men have to be armed.
The men are to be armed, with their phasers locked, I repeat, locked,
on setting number one. There can't be any chance of him being killed.
He's to be taken without. If the men are forced to fire, he can't be
killed. 
SPOCK: How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are
to capture you? 
KIRK: Tell them. 
SPOCK: The search parties, Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what
happened. It's a good crew. They deserve to know. 
SPOCK: Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you
can't announce the full truth to the crew. You're the Captain of this
ship. You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew.
You can't afford the luxury of being anything less than perfect. If you
do, they lose faith, and you lose command. 
KIRK: Yes, I do know that, Mister Spock. What I don't know is why I
forgot that just now. Mister Spock, if you see me slipping again, your
orders, your orders are to tell me. 
SPOCK: Understood, Captain.
Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1. Something has
happened to me. Somehow, in being duplicated, I have lost my strength
of will.
Decisions are becoming more and more difficult. 
[Kirk's quarters]
KIRK [OC]: This is the Captain speaking. There's an
impostor aboard the ship, a man who looks exactly like me and is
pretending to be me. This man is dangerous. Utmost caution is to be
observed. All crew members are to arm themselves. The impostor may be
identified by scratches on his face. Repeat, the impostor may be
identified by scratches on his face.
[Bridge]
KIRK: Section chiefs, assign personnel to the
search. All search parties 
[Kirk's quarters]
KIRK [OC]: report to Mister Spock for assignment.
[Bridge]
KIRK: Something? 
SPOCK: About the phaser weapons to be set for stunning force and
locked. 
KIRK: Oh, yes, yes. All hand phasers must be set on base cycle,
stunning force.
[Kirk's quarters]
KIRK [OC]: The impostor is not to be injured. Use
minimum force. Repeat, the imposter 
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk! 
KIRK [OC]: Is not to be injured. 
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain
Kirk! (goes to mirror, covers scratches with makeup, opens door)
Wilson! 
WILSON: Sir? 
KIRK: Wilson, give me your phaser. 
WILSON: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: How have you been? 
WILSON: Fine, sir. (Kirk grabs and hits him) 
[Planet surface]
KIRK [OC]: How's it going down there, Mister Sulu? 
SULU: It's already twenty degrees below zero. Can't exactly 
[Briefing room]
SULU [OC]: call it balmy. 
KIRK: Isn't there any way we can help them? 
SPOCK: Thermal heaters were transported down. They duplicated. They
won't operate. 
KIRK: Then we've got to get those men up. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Transporter Technician Wilson found injured near the
Captain's cabin. He says the impostor attacked him, called him by name,
took his hand phaser. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged. Continue the search. 
KIRK: We've got to find him before he, but how? 
SPOCK: Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has
your knowledge of the ship, its crew, its devices. This being the case,
perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move. Knowing how
the ship is laid out, where would you go to elude a mass search? 
KIRK: The lower levels. The Engineering deck.
[Engineering]
SPOCK: Set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to
kill. What about your phaser, Captain? Don't you think we ought to get
some help, Captain? 
KIRK: No. I don't want anyone else to see the 
SPOCK: Captain, you ordered me to tell you. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, if I'm to be the Captain, I've got to act like one.
(they split up to search, and Kirk comes face to face with himself) 
KIRK: You can't hurt me. You can't kill me. You can't. Don't you
understand? I'm part of you. You need me. I need you. 
OTHER KIRK: I don't need you. (Spock neck-pinches him, and his phaser
fire hits a panel instead)
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: He'll be regaining consciousness soon, and
not knowing what his physical state is, I don't think I dare give him a
tranquilizer of any kind. I think we'd better bind him. 
KIRK: Yes. yes, all right. What's the matter with me? 
SPOCK: Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the
power of decision. 
MCCOY: You have a point, Spock? 
SPOCK: Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to
appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms,
the roles of good and evil in a man. His negative side, which you call
hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people
express as compassion, love, tenderness. 
MCCOY: It's the Captain's guts you're analysing. Are you of that,
Spock? 
SPOCK: Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We
see indications that it's his negative side
which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly
controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative
side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you. 
KIRK: What is your point, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be
unable to function as Captain. You must be prepared for that. 
MCCOY: You have your intellect, Jim. You can fight with that! 
KIRK: For how long? 
SPOCK: If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain,
understand it's the way I am. 
SCOTT [OC]: Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
SCOTT [OC]: Mister Scott, sir, on the lower level of the Engineering
deck. 
[Engineering]
SCOTT: I've found a new trouble with the
transporter. The casing has a wide gap ripped in it. (the phaser
damage) The main circuits
[Sickbay]
SCOTT [OC]: have been burned through. The abort
control circuit is gone altogether.
[Planet surface]
SULU: Can you give us a status report, Captain?
Temperature's still dropping. Now forty one degrees below zero. 
KIRK [OC]: We've located the trouble. It shouldn't be much longer. 
SULU: Do you think you might be able to find a long rope somewhere and
lower us down a pot of hot coffee?
[Sickbay]
KIRK: I'll see what we can do. 
SULU [OC]: Rice wine will do, if you're short on coffee. 
KIRK: Engineering deck, Kirk here. 
SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, Captain. 
KIRK: That unit, Scotty, status report. 
SCOTT [OC]: The transporter unit ioniser. Nothing much left of it, sir.
KIRK: How bad is it? 
SCOTT [OC]: We can't repair it in less than a week.
Captain's Log, stardate 1673.5. Transporter still
inoperable. My negative self is under restraint in Sickbay. My own
indecisiveness growing. My force of will steadily weakening. On the
planet, condition critical. Surface temperature is seventy five degrees
below zero, still dropping.
[Planet surface]
SULU: (using phaser to heat rocks) I think we ought
to give room service another call. That coffee's taking too long.
Enterprise, this is Sulu.
[Briefing room]
KIRK: Kirk here, Mister Sulu. 
SULU [OC]: Hot line direct to the Captain. Are we that far gone? 
KIRK: I gave everybody the afternoon off. I'm watching the store. 
[Planet surface]
KIRK [OC]: How is it down there? 
SULU: Oh, lovely, except that the frost is building up. We're using
hand phasers to heat the rocks. One phaser quit on us,
three still operating. Any possibility of getting us back aboard before
the skiing season opens down here?
[Briefing room]
SPOCK: This is Spock, Mister Sulu. You'll have to
hold on a little longer. There's no other way. Survival procedures,
Mister Sulu. 
SULU [OC]: Per your training programme, Mister Spock.
[Sickbay]
(other Kirk is screaming) 
KIRK: What happened? 
MCCOY: Apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication
process. A fact I failed to consider. 
KIRK: He's not dying? 
KIRK: Yes, he is. 
OTHER KIRK: Help me. 
KIRK: How can he die? Can I survive without him? 
MCCOY: I don't know, Jim. 
KIRK: Don't be afraid. Here's my hand. Hold on. You don't have to be
afraid. I won't let go. Hold on. You won't be afraid if you use your
mind and think! Think! You can do it. That's it! 
MCCOY: Jim, he is back! Jim, you can use that brandy now. In fact, I'll
join you. 
KIRK: I have to take him back inside myself. I can't survive without
him. I don't want him
back. He's like an animal, a thoughtless, brutal animal, and yet it's
me. Me. 
MCCOY: Jim, you're no different than anyone else. We all have our
darker side. We need it! It's half of what we are. It's not really
ugly, it's human. 
KIRK: Human. 
MCCOY: Yes, human. A lot of what he is makes you the man you are. God
forbid I should have to agree with Spock, but he was right. Without the
negative side, you wouldn't be the Captain. You couldn't be, and you
know it. Your strength of command lies mostly in him. 
KIRK: What do I have? 
MCCOY: You have the goodness. 
KIRK: Not enough. I have a ship to command. 
MCCOY: The intelligence, the logic. It appears your half has most of
that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from. For
you see, he was afraid and you weren't. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. Would you come to the transporter room. We
think we may have found an answer. 
KIRK: Coming.
[Transporter room]
KIRK: What is it? 
SCOTT: We've found a way to get the transporter working, sir. 
SPOCK: We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for
the difference. Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't
be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance. I suggest
we send the animal through.
Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, yes. Go ahead. 
SCOTT: (opening box with angry animal in it) I'll grab him by the
scruff of the neck and hold him as long as I can. 
KIRK: Don't hurt him. 
SPOCK: It's painless and quick. The animal will be unconscious for only
a few minutes. (sedates it) 
SCOTT: If this doesn't work, I don't know what will. 
SPOCK: Energise. Reverse. 
SPOCK: The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too
much for him. 
MCCOY: He's dead, Jim.
Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1. Entry made by
Second Officer Spock. Captain Kirk retains command of this vessel, but
his force of will rapidly fading. Condition of landing party critical.
Transporter unit still under repair.
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: Autopsy in-depth. Hurry. I don't know.
Animal could have died of some kind of shock. 
SPOCK: For once, I agree with you. 
MCCOY: I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a
full post-mortem. 
SPOCK: No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified,
confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back
together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror. 
KIRK: Yes, yes, that sounds likely. 
SPOCK: It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence
controlling your fear. 
KIRK: Get the transporter room ready. 
MCCOY: Could be, if, maybe. All guesswork so far. Just theory. Jim, why
don't you give me a chance to do an autopsy and let Spock check the
transporter circuits again. 
KIRK: That sounds, sounds reasonable. We should double-check
everything. 
SPOCK: Aren't you forgetting something, Captain? 
KIRK: No, I don't think I've for 
SPOCK: Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left?
KIRK: Yes, that's right. The men. We have to take the chance, Bones.
Their lives 
MCCOY: Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim. Suppose death was caused by
transporter malfunction. Then you'd die. They'd die, anyway.
Jim, you can't risk your life on a theory! 
SPOCK: Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a
human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at
war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because
my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your
intelligence would enable you to survive as well. 
KIRK: Help me. Somebody make the decision. 
SPOCK: Are you relinquishing your command, Captain? 
KIRK: No. No, I'm not. 
MCCOY: Well then, we can't help you, Jim. The decision is yours. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, ready the transporter room. Bones, continue the
autopsy. 
UHURA [OC]: Captain Kirk, I have a tie-in with Sulu now. 
KIRK: Kirk here.
[Planet surface]
SULU: Captain K-Kirk, Sulu here. One hundred
seventeen below. Can't last much longer. 
[Sickbay]
SULU [OC]: Can't see clearly, Doctor, to read top
indicator. Think the cold penetrating communicator. Two men
unconscious. No time. No. Can't wait. No time. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu. Can't wait. Can't let them die. 
OTHER KIRK: What are you going to do? 
KIRK: Go through the transporter, both of us. 
OTHER KIRK: There's nothing I can do to stop you. 
KIRK: It's what I have to do. It's what I have to do. What we have to
do. 
OTHER KIRK: I won't fight you anymore. Oh, I feel so weak. I'll be glad
when this is over. (grabs Kirk and knocks him out)
[Corridor]
KIRK: Janice, hello. 
RAND: Captain, I 
KIRK: Yeoman, I owe you an explanation. 
RAND: No. 
KIRK: Yes, I do. The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a
duplicate. The animal part of me came to your cabin. He even scratched
me to make us look more alike. I'd like the chance to explain it to
you. You don't mind if I come to your cabin later? 
RAND: No, sir. 
KIRK: (enters turbolift) Bridge.
[Bridge]
FARRELL: No word from Mister Sulu, sir. 
OTHER KIRK: Prepare to leave orbit, Mister Farrell. Well? 
FARRELL: Captain! 
OTHER KIRK: I gave you an order, Mister Farrell. 
FARRELL: But what about 
OTHER KIRK: They can't be saved. Prepare to leave orbit. 
FARRELL: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: Captain, I thought the plan 
OTHER KIRK: I've changed my mind. Man your station, Mister Spock.
(McCoy enters with another Kirk, identically dressed) Grab him. He's
the impostor. 
MCCOY: No! 
OTHER KIRK: McCoy, he's fooled you. 
MCCOY: He (the one in the captain's chair) attacked him. 
OTHER KIRK: Mister Spock, you know who I am. You know what that is. 
FARRELL: Mister Spock, which one? What do we do? 
SPOCK: We'll let the captain handle this. 
OTHER KIRK: I'm the captain. Isn't that obvious? Look at his face.
Remember the scratches? Look how he's tried to hide them. He wants you
to think that he's Captain Kirk. You know who I am. 
KIRK: Yes, I know. 
OTHER KIRK: You want to kill me, don't you? Farrell, James, grab him.
He'll destroy the ship! I'm the Captain. Don't you understand? I'm
captain of the ship! (starts attacking the crew) I'm the captain! This
is my ship! My ship! It's mine! I'll kill you. 
KIRK: Can half a man live? 
OTHER KIRK: Take another step, you'll die. 
KIRK: Then we'll both die. 
OTHER KIRK: Please, I don't want to. Don't make me. Don't make me.
(Kirk takes phaser off him) I don't want to go back. Please! I want to
live! 
KIRK: You will. Both of us. 
OTHER KIRK: I want to live!
[Transporter room]
SPOCK: You'll have to hold on to him, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Captain? 
KIRK: If this doesn't work. 
SPOCK: Understood, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Ready. (beams them out) 
MCCOY: Well, Mister Spock? (one figure is beamed back) Jim? 
KIRK: Get those men aboard fast. 
SPOCK: Right away, Captain. 
MCCOY: (as the party is wheeled away) Severe exposure and frostbite,
but I think they'll make it. How do you feel, Jim? 
KIRK: How? I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see.
[Bridge]
FARRELL: Status report, green. 
SPOCK: All sections report ready, sir. 
KIRK: Good. Thank you, Mister Spock, from both of us. 
SPOCK: Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir? 
KIRK: The impostor's back where he belongs. Let's forget him. 
RAND: Captain? The impostor told me what happened, who he really was,
and I'd just like to say that. Well, sir, what I'd like is 
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman. 
SPOCK: The, er, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you
say, Yeoman? 
KIRK: This is the Captain speaking. Navigator, set in course
correction. Helmsman, steady as she goes.

1329.8
Original Airdate: 13 Oct, 1966
 
Captain's log, Stardate 1329.8. The U.S.S. Enterprise in pursuit of an
unidentified vessel.
[Bridge]
SULU: There he is, sir. Centre screen. Still trying
to run away from us, sir. 
KIRK: Don't lose him, Mister Sulu.
SULU: No, sir.
KIRK: Earth ship, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Difficult to say, Captain. We're getting no registration beam
from it.
SCOTT: If it is, he'll soon overload his engines.
SPOCK: Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard. 
SULU: Changing course again. He knows we're after him all right.
KIRK: Stay with him, Mister Sulu. Communication?
UHURA: I've tried all frequencies, sir. He refuses to answer. Unless
he's not receiving us. 
KIRK: He's receiving us alright. 
SPOCK: Approaching an asteroid belt, Captain. Schiller rating three
five. 
KIRK: Deflectors on, Mister Farrell. 
SULU: He's seen the asteroids too, sir. 
KIRK: Stay with him. He'll try to lose us in them. 
SULU: If one hits him. 
SPOCK: Sensor reading on the vessel. I make it out as a small class J
cargo ship, and his engines are super-heating. 
KIRK: Try to warn him. If he loses power now 
FARRELL: There go his engines, sir. 
SULU: He's drifting into the asteroid belt, Captain. 
FARRELL: He's had it, unless we put our deflector screen around him. 
SCOTT: Captain, if we try, we'll overload our own engines. He's too far
away. 
KIRK: Cover him with our deflector screen, Mister Farrell. Scotty,
Spock, stand by in the transporter room. 
SCOTT: Aye, sir. (they leave) 
FARRELL: We're protecting him, sir. We won't be able to hold it long. 
SULU: We're overloading, Captain. Engine temperatures climbing. 
CREWMAN [OC]: This is the Engine room. Temperatures are passing the
danger line. 
FARRELL Our deflector screen's weakening, sir. We can't protect them
much longer. (lights flicker)
SULU: That was one of our lithium crystal circuits, sir. 
KIRK: Bridge to transporter room. If you don't start beaming that crew
over soon 
SCOTT [OC]: They're not answering our signal. There's nothing to lock
onto. 
SULU (lights go out again) Another circuit, sir. 
UHURA: I'm getting a distress signal call from them, sir. 
KIRK: Scotty, we're getting a distress signal. 
[Transporter room]
SCOTT: We're locked onto something, Captain. 
MUDD: Meaning no ingratitude, gentlemen, but just where is it I find
meself? 
MCCOY: You're aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. 
MUDD: It's really a darn beautiful ship, isn't it? Really a beautiful
ship. Oh, the name, gentlemen, is Walsh, Captain Leo Walsh. 
SPOCK: How many more in your crew? 
MUDD: Just a few more. 
SCOTT: Your vessel's breaking up, man. If we don't get them over here
right now 
MUDD: We couldn't be sure you was a friendly vessel, now could we. Ah,
but the three will be in position about by now.
[Bridge]
SULU: Another lithium circuit. Now supplementing
with battery power, sir. 
KIRK: Scotty, how many of them did you get aboard? 
SCOTT [OC]: Only one, sir, but we've locked onto three more.
[Transporter room]
SPOCK: What's wrong? 
SCOTT: I don't know, sir. With those three lithium crystals gone 
SPOCK: It'll take longer on battery power. 
MCCOY: Never trusted this. 
[Bridge]
FARRELL: There she goes. 
SULU: Asteroid hit him dead centre. 
[Transporter room]
KIRK [OC]: Bridge to transporter room. Their vessel
has been hit by an asteroid. It's gone. Did you get the crew off? 
SCOTT: Not yet, sir, but we've hooked onto something. (three women beam
in, the men are transfixed) 
KIRK [OC]: Kirk to transporter room. Report. 
MUDD: It's all right, darlings. We're in good hands. 
[Bridge]
KIRK: Bridge to transporter room. 
FARRELL: We're clearing the asteroid belt now, Captain. 
KIRK: Deflector screen down, Mister Farrell. Save the power. 
[Transporter room]
KIRK [OC]: Captain to transporter room. Are you
reading me or not, Mister Scott? Bridge to transporter room. How many
did we get off? 
SCOTT: Oh, er, four in all, sir. 
KIRK [OC]: If that captain can walk, I want him in my cabin
immediately. Correction, 
[Bridge]
KIRK: I want him there whether he can walk or not.
Kirk out. 
[Transporter room]
MUDD: That fellow sounded a mite upset, didn't he? 
MCCOY: Yes. Yes, they are. 
SPOCK: Curious. You're certain this was everyone aboard, Mister Walsh?
No other crewmen? 
MUDD: Oh, no, that's everyone, all right, but so far as the ladies
actually being the crew 
SPOCK: You can explain that to the Captain. (the group leave) 
MCCOY: Amen to that, Scotty.
[Corridor]
MUDD: Ah, sure, these starships are really
something marvellous, but men will always be men no matter where they
are. Eh, mister? You'll never take that out of them.
[Turbolift]
SPOCK: Deck twelve. 
MUDD: You're part Vulcanian, aren't you. Ah well then, a pretty face
doesn't affect you at all, does it. That is, unless you want it to. You
can save it, girls. This type can turn himself off from any emotion. 
EVE: I apologise for what he said, sir. He's used to buying and selling
people. 
MUDD: I'll handle the conversation, darling.
[Captain's quarters]
KIRK: Come. 
SPOCK: The Commander of the transport to see you, Captain. 
KIRK: Good. Now, if you don't mind telling 
EVE: Hello. 
KIRK: And the ladies? Is this your crew, Captain? 
MUDD: Well, no, Captain. This is me cargo.
Captain's log, Stardate 1329.1. We've taken aboard
from unregistered transport vessel its captain and, and three unusual
females. These women have a mysterious magnetic effect on the male
members of my crew, including myself. Explanation unknown at present.
[Captain's quarters]
MUDD: Well, how the devil am I supposed to know
this is a starship, Captain? Here I am with a cargo of young lovelies.
A strange ship comes up alongside. Well. naturally I did my best to
evade you. And starship Captain or no, you exceeded your authority when
you drove me and mine into a shower of asteroids. 
KIRK: Your name, please. 
MUDD: Walsh. Leo Walsh. You destroyed me ship, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Walsh, I'm convening a ship's hearing on your actions.
Mister Spock will supply you with any legal information
you may need for your defence. 
MUDD: You're a hard-nosed one, Captain. 
KIRK: And you're a liar, Mister Walsh. I think we both understand each
other. Security! Escort Mister Walsh to his quarters. Confine him
there.
[Bridge]
SULU: You're on duty, Johnny-o. Back to reality. 
FARRELL: You can feel their eyes when they look at you, like something
grabbing hold of you. Did you notice that? 
SULU: I noticed. How I noticed. Come on, Johnny. 
SCOTT: We've got trouble, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: One lithium crystal left, and that with a hairline split at the
base. 
SPOCK: Better rig a by-pass circuit. 
SCOTT: Can't. We blew the whole converter assembly. 
KIRK [OC]: Kirk here. 
SPOCK: Needed on the bridge, Captain.
[Briefing room]
WOMEN: Harry! Where were you? 
MUDD: Shh! Calm down now, darlings. Would you mind waiting outside? 
SECURITY: Sorry, sir. 
MUDD: Well, now, answer every question they put to you. Don't lie.
Well, you've no need to, have you, and don't submit to a med. That is,
being so healthy, they've no need for a medical exam, have they. 
RUTH: What if they ask about 
MUDD: They won't. Have you no place to go lads? 
MAGDA: They'll notice we're different. 
MUDD: No, no, no, they won't. Just let Leo take all the hard questions.
Now don't be panicking, loves. We'll get to 
EVE: Get where? We don't have a ship and we're headed the wrong way,
Harry. 
NUDD: Leo. Leo Walsh is me name, darling. Don't forget that. So lovely.
Lovely, aren't they? If they only think lovely thoughts, if they smile,
they'll come out right some which way, won't they? My personal
guarantee on that.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: The entire ship's power is feeding through
one lithium crystal. 
KIRK: Well, switch to by-pass circuits. 
SCOTT: We burned them all out when we super-heated. That jackass Walsh
not only wrecked his vessel, but in saving his skin 
KIRK: If it makes you feel better, Engineer, that's one jackass we're
going to see skinned. 
SCOTT: But it's frustrating. Almost a million gross tons of vessel
depending on a hunk of crystal the size of my fist. 
SPOCK: And that crystal won't hold up, not pulling all our power
through it. 
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: There's a lithium mining operation on Rigel 12. High-grade ore,
I've heard. 
KIRK: Location and distance. 
SPOCK: Mister Farrell has the course. Less than two day's travel. 
KIRK: Make for Rigel 12, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Rigel 12, Mister Farrell. You have the course.
Captain's log, Stardate 1329.2. On board the U.S.S.
Enterprise, a ship's hearing is being convened against the transport
vessel's captain. I'm becoming concerned about the almost-hypnotic
effect produced by the women.
[Briefing room]
KIRK: This hearing is convened. Stardate 1329.2, on
board starship U.S.S. Enterprise. Formal hearings against transport
captain Leo Walsh. Start computer. 
SPOCK: State your name for the record. 
MUDD: Leo Francis Walsh. 
COMPUTER: Incorrect. 
SPOCK: Your correct name. 
MUDD: Gentlemen, surely you're not going to take the word of a soulless
mechanical device over that of a real flesh and blood man. 
SPOCK: State your correct name for the record. 
MUDD: Harry Mudd. 
COMPUTER: Incorrect. 
MUDD: Harcourt Fenton Mudd. 
SPOCK: Any past offenses, Mister Mudd? 
MUDD: Of course not. Gentlemen, I'm simply an honest businessman. 
COMPUTER: Incorrect. 
MUDD: Blast that tin-plated pot. 
COMPUTER: Full data coming on screen.
RUTH: If it can read our minds, too. 
MUDD: It can't, darling. It can't. Just what's on the record.
COMPUTER: Offense record. Smuggling. Sentence suspended. Transport of
stolen goods. Purchase of space vessel with counterfeit currency.
Sentences, psychiatric treatment, effectiveness disputed. 
KIRK: Mister Mudd, you're charged with galaxy travel without a flight
plan, without an identification beam, and failure to answer a
starship's signal, thus effecting a menace to navigation. 
MUDD: What? My tiny ship in this immense galaxy a menace to navigation?
KIRK: You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's
license. 
MUDD: Untrue! I have a master's ticket. 
COMPUTER: Incorrect. Master's license revoked Stardate 1116.4. 
MUDD: All right. Well, very simply, Leo Walsh, who was to be my captain
on this trip, passed away suddenly. Well, I had no choice but to take
out me ship me own self. I assumed Leo's name out of courtesy to him.
In memoriam, as it were. A fine, fine man, alas, gone to his reward. 
KIRK: Destination and purpose of journey? 
MUDD: Planet Ophiuchus 3. Wiving settlers. 
KIRK: Come again, Mister Mudd. You do what? 
MUDD: I recruit wives for settlers, a difficult but satisfying task. 
KIRK: Data on witnesses. 
COMPUTER: No data. 
KIRK: Computer, go to sensor probe. Any unusual readings? 
COMPUTER: No decipherable reading on females. However, unusual reading
on male board members. Detecting high respiration patterns,
perspiration rate up, heartbeat rapid, blood pressure higher than
normal. 
KIRK: Er, that's sufficient. Strike that from the record. 
MUDD: You see, gentlemen, just as I told you. Three lovely ladies
destined for frontier planets to be the companions of lonely men, to
supply that warmth of a human touch that's so desperately needed. A
wife, a home, a family. Gentlemen, I look upon this work as a sacred
public trust. I've devoted me whole life to it. 
COMPUTER: Incorrect. 
MUDD: Well, I'm about to start devoting my entire life to it. 
KIRK: Did these ladies come voluntarily? 
MUDD: Well, of course! Now, for example, Ruthie here comes from a
pelagic planet, sea ranchers. Magda there from the helium experimental
station. 
EVE: It's the same story for all of us, Captain. No men. Mine was a
farm planet with automated machines for company and two brothers to
cook for, mend their clothes, canal mud a foot thick on their boots
every time they walked in. 
MUDD: Fine, Evie. Fine. 
EVE: It's not fine! We've got men willing to be our husbands waiting
for us, and you're taking us in the opposite direction!
Staring at us Iike we were Saturnius harem girls or something. 
MUDD: That's enough, Evie. 
KIRK: The only charges are against Mister Mudd. Illegal operation of a
vessel. Do you have any defence to offer? 
MUDD: Only heaven's own truth, which I've just given you. 
KIRK: The hearing is closed. Mister Mudd to be handed over to the legal
authorities at our earliest opportunity. 
EVE: And what about us? What happens to us? Help us, please. All of us.
KIRK: Miss McHuron, if you don't mind 
SCOTT: Our last crystal, sir. It's gone. 
SULU: Captain Kirk, engineering section reports our entire life-support
system is now on batteries. 
KIRK: Mister Spock. Miss McHuron, would you mind. Mister Spock, will
you contact the miners on Rigel 12? Notify them that we'll need the
lithium crystals immediately upon arrival. (all officers leave) 
MUDD: Oh, you beautiful galaxy! Oh, that heavenly universe! Well,
girls, lithium miners. Don't you understand? Lonely, isolated,
overworked, rich lithium miners! Girls, do you still want husbands,
hmm? Evie, you won't be satisfied with a mere ship's captain. I'll get
you a man who can buy you a whole planet. Maggie, you're going to be a
countess. Ruth, I'll make you a duchess. And I, I'll be running this
starship. Captain James Kirk, the next orders you're taking will be
given by Harcourt Fenton Mudd!
Captain's log-- Stardate 1330.1. Position, fourteen
hours out of Rigel 12. We're on auxiliary impulse engines. Fuel low,
barely sufficient to achieve orbit over the planet. Lithium
replacements are now imperative. The effect of Mudd's women on my crew
continues to grow, still totally unexplained. Harry Mudd is confined to
his quarters under guard.
[Sickbay]
RUTH: May I come in? 
MCCOY: Why, yes, please do. By all means. Connors, are you finished? 
RUTH: I was wondering what this place looked like. It's fascinating. 
MCCOY: Would, Would you walk past my panel again, please? 
RUTH: Your what? 
MCCOY: My medical scanner. 
RUTH: Oh, why? You're not giving me an examination, are you? 
MCCOY: Oh no. I wouldn't trust my, my judgment, believe me. Just walk
by, please. (scanner heart monitor activates) It's not supposed to do
that. 
RUTH: I wondered, will you be examining the miners on Rigel 12? 
MCCOY: Yes, if they need it. 
RUTH: You haven't asked yet? Are they in good health and all? 
MCCOY: What? Oh, yes, they're in excellent health, all three of them. 
RUTH: Oh. Three. 
MCCOY: Are you wearing some unusual kind of perfume or something
radioactive, my dear? 
RUTH: No. I'm just me. 
MCCOY: I wonder what makes it do that.
[Kirk's quarters]
EVE: Captain? I hope you don't mind. 
KIRK: As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do. 
EVE: I was trying to take a walk, and I just, I just had to run in
someplace. You see, all your men were looking at me, following me with
their eyes. 
KIRK: Yes. I'll have to talk to them about that. They, er, they don't
do that ordinarily, Miss McHuron, but somehow, in your case, and the
ladies with you, its, er 
EVE: They're probably just lonely. I can understand loneliness. 
KIRK: Yes. Yes, er, now, Miss McHuron 
EVE: I, I suppose you understand it even more, having to run a huge
ship like this with so much responsibility every minute
and having to be so careful with all your men looking up to you. 
KIRK: Well, it probably appears more difficult than it is. 
EVE: Hmm! I read once that a commander has to act like a paragon of
virtue. I never met a paragon. 
KIRK: Neither have I. 
EVE: Well, of course not. No one is. But some people try to pretend. Do
you, Captain? 
KIRK: Miss McHuron, I don't 
EVE: Oh, no! Oh, I just can't do it. I don't care what Harry Mudd says.
I do like you, but I just can't go through with it. I hate this whole
thing!
[Mudds's quarters]
MUDD: Just three? You're sure? 
RUTH: Yes. The miners are healthy and fairly young. 
MUDD: Later, dear, later. Magda, did you get to your communications
man? 
MAGDA: The head miner is named Ben Childress. The others are Gossett
and Benton. 
MUDD: And they've been there? 
RUTH: Almost three years now, alone! 
MUDD: Perfect. Perfect. Three of them and three lovely ladies has Harry
Mudd. And lithium crystals, my dear, are worth three hundred times
their weight in diamonds, thousands of times their weight in gold. 
RUTH: But they'll be down there, and we'll be up here, circling a
hundred miles above them. 
MAGDA: And there's a guard outside your door, Harry. You can't get out
of your cabin. 
MUDD: No, my dears. After one more job for you, it won't be Harry Mudd
that's trapped. It will be a gentleman named James T 
EVE: I don't like you, and I'm not very happy with myself, either. 
MUDD: Well, I'm not really surprised. I've seen you noticing the
Captain. 
EVE: We're supposed to notice them! Oh, oh Harry, I don't feel very
good. I think it must be near the time.
[Bridge]
KIRK: I asked for a preorbital course, Mister
Farrell. 
FARRELL: Preorbital course locked in, sir. 
KIRK: That's the last time I'm giving an order twice, gentlemen. We're
down to battery power, and we're low on that. 
SCOTT: It'll get us to Rigel 12, sir, but it'll be a shaky orbit. 
KIRK: Just hang us in long enough to get six crystals, Scotty. That's
all we need. 
SCOTT: I'll get you there. 
KIRK: Ridiculous. What are we running here. Did you examine them? Did
you examine Eve? 
MCCOY: She refused. 
KIRK: Well, come on, you're the doctor. What is it? Is it that we're
tired, and they're beautiful? They are incredibly beautiful. 
MCCOY: Are they, Jim? Are they actually more lovely, pound for pound,
measurement for measurement, than any other women you've known? Or is
it that they just, well, act beautiful. No. Strike that, strike that. 
KIRK: What are they? 
MCCOY: You mean are they alien illusions? That sort of thing? 
KIRK: I asked you first. 
MCCOY: No, an alien smart enough to pull this could also keep my
medical scanner from going beep! 
KIRK: I don't follow you. 
MCCOY: I don't either.
[Mudd's quarters]
MAGDA: Top space frequency of three nine. (hands
over communicator) 
MUDD: Rigel 12. Rigel 12. 
CHILDRESS [OC]: This is Rigel 12. Come in, Enterprise. 
MUDD: Well, this isn't exactly the Enterprise. My name is Harry Mudd.
To whom have I the pleasure of speaking, sir?
[Bridge]
SULU: Power curve still dropping, Captain. 
FARRELL: We'll make orbit, sir. A temporary one. 
KIRK: Lay in. Computer? 
SPOCK: We can sustain this orbit for three days, seven hours. 
KIRK: More than enough time. Communications, have a representative of
the Rigel 12 miners meet us here to discuss our needs. Beam him up
first pass over their camp. 
UHURA: Yes, sir. 
[Mudd's quarters]
RUTH: Look what's happening. (hair lank, skin
slightly lined) Look at my face. 
MAGDA: Give us the pills. 
RUTH: What if someone sees us like this? 
EVE: You'll never find them, Harry, and if you do find them you know
what they are. A cheat. If you care for someone, really care 
MUDD: (ransacking drawers frantically) For whom, Evie? For Kirk? You'll
find out that Ship's captains are already married, girl, to their
vessels. You'd find out the first time you came between him and the
ship. You'll see. 
RUTH: I'm going back to what I was. Ugly. 
MAGDA: I can't stand myself like this. 
RUTH: Why did you hide them, Harry? Don't you trust us? 
MUDD: I didn't hide them, girl. I put them in a safe place in case I
was searched. 
MADGA: Find the pill, Harry! 
MUDD: Mattress! Yes, here! (Ruth and Magda devour them eagerly) Go on,
Eve. Take it. It's not a cheat. It's a miracle for some man who can
appreciate it and who needs it.
[Kirk's quarters]
SPOCK: Even burned and cracked, they're beautiful.
Destroying them was a shame. 
KIRK: Not at all, Mister Spock. The choice was burning this lithium
crystal or the destruction of another man's ship. Come.
SECURITY: Sir. Mining Chief Childress and Mister Gossett. 
KIRK: Good. Show them in. I'm James Kirk, captain of the Enterprise.
This is my science officer Mister Spock. 
CHILDRESS: Let's get right to business. You want lithium crystals and
we've got them. 
KIRK: Fine. I'm authorised to pay an equitable price. 
CHILDRESS: We're not sure they're for sale, Captain. We might prefer a
swap. 
KIRK: What did you have in mind? 
CHILDRESS: Mudd's women. 
GOSSETT: If we like them. We'd like to have a look at them first of
course. 
CHILDRESS: Right. Trot them out, Captain. Oh, and Harry Mudd. Either
way, I've agreed to have him released. Charges dropped. 
KIRK: (laughs) Is there anything else? 
CHILDRESS: You've got no choice, Kirk. You beam a landing party down,
and you won't find one blessed crystal. 
KIRK: No deal. You're a long way out in space, gentlemen. You'll need
medical help, cargo runs, starship protection. You want to consider
those facts too? 
MUDD: Come along, ladies, come along. You must be Ben Childress. Come
on now, girls, come on. 
RUTH: And you must be Herm Gossett. 
GOSSETT: Yes, I reckon I am. 
CHILDRESS: One thing I'll say for you, Mudd, you're not a liar. Ladies,
you are welcome. 
KIRK: It's still no deal. 
SPOCK: Conserving batteries, sir. Half power. 
MUDD: I'm told they have only three days of orbit left before they
start spiraling in. I do hate to see you suffering such a situation,
Captain, but truth is truth, and the sad fact is you will deal. Sooner
or later, you'll have to.
Captain's log. Transporting down to surface of
planet Rigel 12 to acquire replacement lithium crystals. Expect further
difficulty from miners.
[Miner's camp]
KIRK: All right, Childress, you've won. Now I'll
take the lithium crystals. 
CHILDRESS: When I have the time, Kirk. 
KIRK: Childress. 
CHILDRESS: We're busy, Mister Kirk. 
SPOCK: We don't have the time to spare, Captain. 
KIRK: You got a better idea? 
CHILDRESS: (to Eve) Blows like that all the time. You can get lost a
dozen feet from your doorstep. The wind comes up sudden.
Magnetic storm. That means the wind will really rip soon. 
MAGDA: Dance with me. 
CHILDRESS: Would you like to dance? 
EVE: No, I (coughs) No. I'm sorry, I guess it must be the dust. 
CHILDRESS: That's the way it is on Rigel all the time. (cuts in on Ruth
instead) 
GOSSETT: Hey. 
BENTON: Go away. 
GOSSETT: I'm cutting in. 
BENTON: Not on me. (fight starts) 
CHILDRESS: What's the matter with you? 
EVE: Why don't you run a raffle and the loser gets me? (leaves) 
CHILDRESS: You can't go out there. You'll get killed. 
KIRK: Just have those crystals here when I get back.
[Planet surface]
KIRK: Eve! Eve!
Captain's log. Have transported aboard the
Enterprise to implement search with infrared scanners and sensing
system.
Magnetic storms on the planet's surface are cutting down speed and
efficiency of our equipment. Search now in progress for three hours,
eighteen minutes.
[Bridge]
FARRELL: Traverse parallel three and four. 
SULU: Checking, but not getting much. 
SPOCK: The storm is ionising the atmosphere, Captain. Getting difficult
to probe through it. 
SCOTT: Captain, this is draining our batteries further. If we only had
those crystals. 
KIRK: But we don't! I didn't get any. I should have found a way.
Satisfied, Mister Scott? 
UHURA: Losing communications with the miners, sir. Magnetic storm seems
worse. 
KIRK: Has Childress reported in yet? 
UHURA: No, sir. He and the girl are still missing. 
KIRK: Sorry, Scotty. How much power do we have left? 
SCOTT: About five hours, sir.
Captain's log. Have expended all but forty three
minutes of power. Ship's condition, critical. Search now in progress
seven hours, thirty one minutes. Magnetic storms are easing.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Infrared reading. Check traverse three, grid
zero four zero. 
FARRELL: About eleven miles, bearing one two one from the mining
company. 
SULU: That's Ben Childress' quarters. 
SPOCK: There's a heat unit operating in there. It could be a cookstove.
KIRK: Have Mudd meet me in the transporter room. 
SPOCK: Mudd? 
KIRK: The name of this game.
[Childress' quarters]
CHILDRESS: I had things where I wanted them. 
EVE: I ate some of your food, so I paid with some chores. 
CHILDRESS: And I do my own cooking. I've not laid a hand on you.
Remember that. 
EVE: Oh, the sound of male ego. You travel halfway across the galaxy,
and it's still the same song. There. You going to eat or talk? 
CHILDRESS: I guess I'm supposed to sit, taste, and roll my eyes. Ooh,
female cooking again. I've tasted better, by my own hand. 
EVE: Well you're tasting some of it now. I couldn't scrape three layers
of your leavings out of that pan. 
CHILDRESS: You find me a well, some decent water, then talk. 
EVE: Well, why don't you hang your pan out in the wind and let the sand
blast it clean, or hadn't you thought about that? 
CHILDRESS: (after hanging out the pots) It might work. That solitaire? 
EVE: Double jack. 
CHILDRESS: The red eight ought to go on the black nine. 
EVE: Not in double jack. 
CHILDRESS: You're not only plain as an old bucket, you're not even good
company. What the devil happened to your looks, anyway? 
EVE: I got tired of you. I slumped. 
CHILDRESS: You heard what I said. You're homely! I've got enough in
crystals already to buy queens by the gross! (Kirk and Mudd enter) I
didn't touch her. 
MUDD: Thank heaven you found her. 
CHILDRESS: She's been bubbling with gratitude ever since. 
KIRK: Sit down. Tell him. Tell him, Harry. 
MUDD: Ah. Yes, well. 
KIRK: The Venus drugs, Harry. 
CHILDRESS: Venus drug? I've heard of it but, it's not just one of those
stories? 
KIRK: Oh, it exists, illegally. 
MUDD: Well, actually, you see, it's a relatively harmless drug. 
EVE: Harmless! 
MUDD: Well, what it does is give you more of whatever you have. Well,
with men, it makes them more muscular. Women, rounder. Men, more
aggressive. Women, more feminine, and 
KIRK: He gave it to the women before you met them. 
CHILDRESS: Does that mean the others? They really look like she does? 
MUDD: Mister Childress, I 
CHILDRESS: Is that what it means? 
EVE: Yes, that's what it means! 
CHILDRESS: What happened to my partners? 
KIRK: They've left for their quarters during the storm, Childress.
They're married. Subspace radio marriage. It was a fraud. They can get
out of it. 
MUDD: If they want to. 
CHILDRESS: Why? 
MUDD: You can't condemn the women. 
CHILDRESS: I can! A man goes out and fights, almost dies. We all almost
die. We should have, but we didn't. And now that we've got the good
life in our hands, you bring us women for wives that 
EVE: You don't want wives, you want this. This is what you want, Mister
Childress. I hope you remember it and dream about it, because you can't
have it. It's not real! (takes the pills) Is this the kind of wife you
want, Ben? Not someone to help you, not a wife to cook and sew and cry
and need, but this kind. Selfish, vain, useless. Is this what you
really want? All right, then. Here it is. 
KIRK: Quite a woman, eh, Childress? 
CHILDRESS: A fake, pumped up by a drug. 
KIRK: By herself. She took no drug. 
EVE: I swallowed it. 
KIRK: Coloured gelatin. 
MUDD: Yes, they took away my drug and substituted that. 
EVE: But that can't be. 
KIRK: There's only one kind of woman. 
MUDD: Or man, for that matter. 
KIRK: You either believe in yourself, or you don't. All right
Childress, I've gone as far with you as I intend to. I want those
lithium crystals and I want them now. Enterprise, this is Kirk. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. 
KIRK: Stand by. Do I beam down a search party? 
CHILDRESS: No, the crystals are here, and you're welcome to them. 
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Spock. We're coming aboard with the lithium
crystals. 
SPOCK [OC]: How many coming, Captain? 
CHILDRESS: Eve will stay, today at least. We, er, we want to talk. 
KIRK: Eve? 
EVE: You've got someone up there called the Enterprise. 
KIRK: Two of us, Mister Spock. Come on, Mister Mudd. 
MUDD: Don't you think you could possibly, by accident, arrange to leave
me behind here? On this planet that would be punishment enough. 
KIRK: I can't do that, Harry, but I will appear as a character witness
at your trial. If you think that'll help. 
MUDD: They'll throw away the key.
[Bridge]
MCCOY: That must have been quite a talk you made
down there. Ever try considering the patent medicine business? 
KIRK: Why should I work your side of the street? 
SPOCK: I'm happy the affair is over. A most annoying emotional episode.
MCCOY: Smack right in the old heart. Oh, I'm sorry. In your case, it
would be about here. 
SPOCK: The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours,
Doctor, pleases me no end. 
FARRELL: Course plotted and all systems in operation. 
SULU: Engines engaged. Helm answering. 
FARRELL: Out of orbit, sir. 
KIRK: Ahead full. 
SULU: Ahead full, sir.

Original Airdate: 20 Oct, 1966
  [Bridge]
CREWMAN [OC]: All sections, security check in
progress. Report. Forward phaser 
KIRK: We're entering standard orbit, Nurse. It won't be much longer. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Forward scanner to Bridge.
KIRK: I understand you gave up a career in bio-research to sign aboard
a starship.
CHAPEL: I know he's alive down there, Captain. 
CREWMAN 2 [OC]: Aft scanner to Bridge, Status report, please.
Engineering controls 
KIRK: It's been five years since his last message. 
CHAPEL: Roger's a very determined man. He'd find a way to live. 
UHURA: Beginning signals to surface, sir. 
KIRK: Put it on all frequencies, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Ship's record banks show little we don't already know about this
planet, Captain.
Gravity is one point one of Earth, atmosphere within safety limits.
KIRK: But the surface temperature of that planet is one hundred degrees
below zero. 
SPOCK: It may have been inhabited once, but the sun in this system has
been fading steadily for a half million years. Now, Doctor Korby, often
called the Pasteur of archaeological medicine. His translation of
medical records from the Orion ruins revolutionised our immunisation
techniques. 
KIRK: Required reading at the academy, Mister Spock. I've always wanted
to meet him. Do you think there's any chance of him still being alive? 
UHURA: I've tried all frequencies, sir. No return signal. 
KIRK: Keep trying. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Warp capacity point zero seven and building. 
CREWMAN 2 [OC]: Communicator, we need more lines to the impulse deck.
CHAPEL: His last signal told about finding underground caverns. 
KIRK: And since then two expeditions have failed to find him. 
UHURA: I've run all frequencies a second time. There's no 
KORBY [OC]: Enterprise, come in, Enterprise. This is Roger Korby.
Repeating, this is Doctor Roger Korby. Do you read me, Enterprise? This
is Doctor Roger Korby standing by.
Captain's log, Stardate 2712.4. A signal from
planet Exo 3. Doctor Roger Korby has been located, he and part of his
expedition remaining alive due to the discovery of underground ruins
Ieft by the former inhabitants of this world.
[Bridge]
KIRK: Enterprise to Korby. We have your
co-ordinates pin-pointed. We're preparing to beam down a party. It may
interest you that we have aboard this vessel 
KORBY [OC]: I've a rather unusual request, Captain Kirk. Beam down
alone, just yourself. We've made discoveries of such a nature they may
require an extraordinary decision from you. 
SPOCK: That's an unusual request. 
KIRK: The man making it is Doctor Roger Korby. 
SPOCK: You're certain you recognise his voice? 
CHAPEL: Have you ever been engaged, Mister Spock? Yes, it's Roger. 
KIRK: Agreed, Doctor. However, there will be two of us. 
CHAPEL: Hello, Roger.
KORBY [OC]: Christine! 
CHAPEL: Yes, Roger. 
KORBY [OC]: Darling, how, Where are you? Yes, yes, by all means,
Captain. I, I had no idea, no hope. Darling, are you all right? 
CHAPEL: Yes, Roger. Everything's all right now.
KIRK: We're on our way, Doctor. We'll be with you in a moment.
Enterprise out.
[Transporter room]
KIRK: Energise. 
[Tunnel entrance]
CHAPEL: He said he'd be waiting.
KIRK: Doctor Korby? Doctor Korby. It's possible we may have hit the
wrong entry point. Kirk to Enterprise. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain.
KIRK: Beam down two security men. 
SPOCK [OC]: Any problems, Captain? 
KIRK: Some delay in meeting us. Probably nothing at all. Kirk out.
Corridors could be quite deep. Getting here may have taken more time
than he estimated. Don't worry. 
CHAPEL: Thank you. 
KIRK: Rayburn, maintain post here. 
RAYBURN: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: Matthews, we'll look for Doctor Korby. Accompany us. 
MATTHEWS: Yes, sir. 
[Tunnels]
(the trio go deeper into the tunnel complex, until
Chapel slips at the edge of a deep pit. Further on they come to a
bright light. A figure steps in front of it) 
KIRK: Is that you, Doctor Korby? 
CHAPEL: Doctor Brown! It's Roger's assistant. Brownie, where's Roger? 
(a man screams, they dash back to the pit. A figure is creeping away,
unseen) 
BROWN: Be careful. 
KIRK: Is there a path down there? 
BROWN: There's no hope, Captain. It's bottomless. He must have slipped.
KIRK: Any chance of a projection or a ledge? 
BROWN: None, Captain. Unfortunate. Terribly unfortunate. Doctor Korby
was detained. I came as soon as I could. 
KIRK: Not soon enough. 
CHAPEL: Brownie, what is it? 
BROWN: Explain. 
CHAPEL: Don't you recognise me? 
BROWN: Christine. You look well. My name is Brown, Doctor Korby's
assistant. I presume you are Captain Kirk. He's dead, I assure you.
Come, Doctor Korby will be waiting. 
KIRK: You do know him well? An old friend? 
CHAPEL: I suppose living here for five years. 
KIRK: Captain Kirk to Rayburn. Report. 
RAYBURN [OC]: All quiet here at the entry, Captain. 
[Tunnel entrance]
RAYBURN: Any problems there, sir? 
KIRK [OC]: We lost Matthews. Apparently an accident. Tell the
Enterprise to have a full security party standing by. 
RAYBURN: Yes, sir. 
KIRK [OC]: And we'll both report in at hourly intervals. If you and I
lose contact, or if he fails to hear from either of us, he's to beam
the security party down immediately. Kirk out. 
(the figure creeps up on Rayburn and attacks him)
[Tunnels]
BROWN: Doctor Korby has discovered that as their
sun dimmed, the inhabitants of this planet moved underground from an
open environment to this dark world. When you were a student of his,
Christine, you must have often heard Doctor Korby remark how freedom of
movement and choice produced the human spirit. The culture of Exo 3
proved his theory. When they moved from light to darkness, they
replaced freedom with a mechanistic culture. Doctor Korby has been able
to uncover elements of this culture which will revolutionise the
universe when freed from this cavernous environment. 
[Korby's study]
ANDREA: I'm Andrea. You must be Christine. I've
always thought how beautiful your name is. And you must be Captain Kirk
of the Starship Enterprise. We appreciate you bringing Roger's fiancee
to him. 
CHAPEL: I don't remember Doctor Korby mentioning an Andrea. 
ANDREA: But you are exactly as Roger described you. No wonder he missed
you so. 
KIRK: Where is Doctor Korby? 
KORBY: Here, Captain. I, I've been looking forward to (sees Chapel, and
they kiss) 
CHAPEL: Oh, I knew I'd find you. 
KORBY: Everything's all right now. Oh, forgive me, Captain. I'm, er,
I'm Roger Korby. 
KIRK: There's no need to apologise, sir, and certainly no need to
introduce yourself. 
BROWN: The captain lost a man in the caverns, Doctor. 
KORBY: What? How did it happen? 
BROWN: The pit near the outer junction. The edge must have given way. 
KORBY: I'm terribly sorry, Captain. Perhaps if I'd been there. I know
the passages so well. 
KIRK: It wasn't your fault. Kirk to Rayburn, report. I'm required to
make a security confirmation. When I call my ship, if you list your
personnel, cargo requirements, any special needs 
KORBY: Captain, I'd much prefer 
KIRK: Rayburn, are you receiving? 
KORBY: I'd prefer you waited, Captain, please, till I've talked to you.
KIRK: I've lost contact with my guard. I'm required to call my ship. 
BROWN: No communications, Captain. (holding weapon) 
CHAPEL: Roger. 
KORBY: I'm sorry. If they should send down more people, 
CHAPEL: Roger, that 
KORBY: He won't be harmed. I promise you. Isn't it possible there could
be things here unknown to you, so terribly important 
KIRK: Sir, one man is dead. I've lost contact with the other. 
KORBY: Andrea. 
KIRK: What are you doing? 
KORBY: This is necessary, Captain. You will understand. Andrea. (she
reaches for Kirk's phaser, but he grabs her to use as a shield and aims
it at Brown instead, while moving towards a table to use as a barrier
instead of the girl) 
KIRK: Drop it! (he fires, Brown falls straight backwards and the big
figure bursts in and lifts Kirk off his feet. Chapel screams as she
sees the hole in Brown reveals electronic parts)
[Bridge]
KIRK [OC]: Enterprise from Captain Kirk. Come in.
Do you read? 
UHURA: Frequency open, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Spock here, Captain. 
KIRK [OC]: Contact established with Doctor Korby. 
SPOCK: We were becoming concerned, Captain. Your check-in was overdue
and since we'd not heard from your security team 
KIRK [OC]: No problem, Mister Spock. Bear with me.
[Korby's study]
RUK [Kirk's voice]: We'll return to the ship within
forty eight hours. Doctor Korby's records and specimens will require
careful packing.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Captain, are you all right? You sound tired.
[Korby's study]
KORBY: If you move or cry out, Ruk may injure you.
At least wait until we can talk. 
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledge, Captain. Is everything all right? 
RUK [Kirk's voice]: Fine, Mister Spock. Doctor Korby has made some
fascinating discoveries. All under control. Stand by for regular
contact. Kirk out. 
KORBY: This is not a vain display, Captain. I'm a scientist. You
obviously know my reputation. Trust me. 
KIRK: Yes, I know your reputation. The whole galaxy knows who you are
and what you stand for. That's why all this makes no sense. 
KORBY: There's so much you must learn Before you make a final judgment.
For example (to Ruk) Andrea. 
RUK [Andrea's voice]: You must be Captain Kirk of the Starship
Enterprise. [Korby's voice] Christine, it's all right now. 
KORBY: You see, Captain? 
RUK [Christine's voice]: Yes Roger, everything is all right now. 
KORBY: That's enough. You are not to mock Christine. You will never
harm her. 
KIRK: Or disobey an order from her. 
KORBY: You will not disobey her orders. Satisfied, Captain Kirk? Both
love and trust. Now, give me twenty four hours to convince you. 
KIRK: Doctor, do I need to be a prisoner to be convinced? 
KORBY: What would your first duty be upon return to your vessel?
Report! Do you realise the number of discoveries lost because of
superstition, of ignorance, of a layman's inability to comprehend? 
KIRK: A simple layman's question, Doctor. Where is my other crewman?
Alive? Dead? 
KORBY: Ruk was programmed to protect my experiments. The logic of his
machine mind saw danger to me. 
KIRK: Where is my other crewman? 
KORBY: Ruk destroyed them both, totally against my wishes I assure you.
KIRK: He's an android like Brown? 
RUK: More complex than Brown. Much superior. I was left here by the old
ones. 
KORBY: Ruk was still tending the machinery when we arrived here. How
many centuries? Even Ruk doesn't know. With his help, ith the records I
could find, we built Brown. 
KIRK: You've convinced me, Doctor. You've convinced me that you're
dangerous. (makes a run for it but Ruk grabs him and throws him around)
KORBY: Ruk, no!
[Dining room]
ANDREA: I do not understand. Why are you unhappy?
You are with Roger again. 
CHAPEL: Where is Captain Kirk? 
ANDREA: You are concerned about the captain?
CHAPEL: Yes, I am concerned.
ANDREA: How can you love Roger without trusting him? Why does it bother
you when I use the name Roger?
KORBY: Andrea, it's sufficient that it does disturb her. You will call
me Doctor Korby from now on, Andrea.
ANDREA: Yes, Doctor Korby. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, darling. As you
can see, Captain Kirk is fine. He won't be harmed. The things at stake
here simply make it necessary he doesn't send a report to his ship. I
need time to explain and demonstrate to him and to you. Now shall we
start with Andrea?
CHAPEL: Yes, let's start with Andrea.
ANDREA: I'm like Doctor Brown, an android. Didn't you know?
KORBY: Remarkable, isn't she? Notice the the lifelike pigmentation, the
variation in skin tones. The flesh, the flesh has warmth. There's even
a pulse, physical sensation.
CHAPEL: How convenient.
KORBY: Christine, you must realise an android's like a computer. It
does only what I
programme.
As a trained scientist yourself, you must realise that 
CHAPEL: Given a mechanical Doctor Brown, a mechanical geisha would be
no more difficult.
KORBY: You think I could love a machine?
CHAPEL: Did you?
KORBY: Andrea's incapable of that. She simply obeys orders. She has no
meaning for me. There's no emotional bond. Andrea, kiss Captain Kirk.
Now strike him. You see? There's no emotion in it, no emotional
involvement. She simply responds to orders. She's a totally logical
computer. A thing is not a woman. Now do you understand? 
KIRK: If these mechanical things have no feelings and perform only as
you programme
them, then why did Brown try to shoot me? Why did he kill two of my
men? There are many things I don't understand, Doctor.
KORBY: I will answer all of your questions now. 
[Laboratory]
KORBY: This is how you make an android. (Kirk is
naked on one side of circular table, a human-shaped blob on the other)
Andrea. (the table starts turning) He's not being harmed, I promise. 
CHAPEL: Roger, what's happened to you? When I sat in your class, you
wouldn't even dream of harming an insect or an animal. Their life was
sacred to you then. 
KORBY: Christine, if I'd simply beamed up to their vessel with Brown
and the others, I'd have given them objects of curiosity, beginnings of
wild stories, foolish theories. Ruk! Watch carefully. (the blob turns
into Kirk, and the table is stopped) Choose, Christine. Which is your
captain? 
CHAPEL: I don't know. They're exact. I honestly don't know. 
KORBY: Synthetic organs are in place. We merely synchronise them with
Kirk's autonomic nervous system, duplicating the rhythms of his body.
At the same time, we duplicate the mental pattern. Now, physical
pattern complete, we now make a mental pattern. Ready for final
synaptic fusion. Andrea, stand by for cortex circuits. The android will
be so perfect It could even replace the captain. The same memories, the
same attitudes, the same abilities. Activate circuits. 
KIRK: Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed
interference, do you hear? Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm
sick of your half-breed (passes out, the other one wakes up) 
KORBY: Complete. 
CHAPEL: Are you all right? 
KIRK: As far as I know. 
KORBY: Now, meet an android. 
KIRK2: How do you do, Miss Chapel?
[Dining room]
ANDREA: I am now programmed to please you also. Is
the food appealing?
CHAPEL: Yes, thank you.
ANDREA: Please sit, Captain. 
KIRK2: Thank you. I'm more or less on parole, I understand.
ANDREA: Doctor Korby suggested that you have lunch. He thought you
might have a few things to talk about.
CHAPEL: Captain. 
KIRK2: I know, I know. I'd hate to be torn between commander and
fiancée myself.
CHAPEL: No, I'm not torn. I'm puzzled. I'm worried. 
KIRK2: Has he confided in you? 
CHAPEL: Nothing he hasn't told you. I know it doesn't make sense. What
he's done may seem wrong, but he is Roger Korby, whatever he seems to
be doing. 
KIRK2: Unless something's gone wrong with his mind. 
CHAPEL: No. You're forgetting how well I know him. He's as sane as you
or I. 
KIRK2: Nurse, if I gave you a direct order to betray him 
CHAPEL: Please, don't ask me to make that choice. I'd much rather you
push me off the same precipice where Matthews died. Oh, I can't.
(pushes plate away) Please, go ahead and eat. 
KIRK2: Androids don't eat, Miss Chapel. 
KORBY: He even has your sense of humour. 
KIRK: Well, there's one difference between us. I'm hungry. 
KIRK2: The difference is your weakness, Captain, not mine. 
KORBY: One at a time, gentlemen. Captain? 
KIRK: Eating is a pleasure, sir. Unfortunately, one you will never
know. 
KIRK2: Perhaps, but I will never starve, sir. 
KIRK: He's an exact duplicate? 
KORBY: In every detail. 
KIRK: What about memory? Tell me about Sam. 
KIRK2: George Samuel Kirk, your brother. Only you call him Sam. 
KIRK: He saw me off on this mission. 
KIRK2: Yes, with his wife and three sons. 
KIRK: He said he was being transferred to Earth colony two research
station. 
KIRK2: No, Captain. He said he was continuing his research and that he
wanted to be transferred to Earth colony two. 
KORBY: You might as well try to outthink a calculating machine. 
KIRK: Obviously, I can't, but we do have some interesting differences. 
KORBY: Totally unimportant ones. You may leave now. (Kirk2 leaves) You
haven't guessed the rest? Not even you, Christine? What you saw was
only a machine, Only half of what I could've accomplished, Do you
understand? By continuing the process I could've transferred you, your
very consciousness into that android. Your soul, if you wish. All of
you. In android form, a human being can have practical immortality. Can
you understand what I'm offering mankind? 
KIRK: Programming. Different word, but the same old promises made by
Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis. 
KORBY: Can you understand that a human converted to an android can be
programmed for the better? Can you imagine how life could be improved
if we could do away with jealousy, greed, hate? 
KIRK: It can also be improved by eliminating love, tenderness,
sentiment. The other side of the coin, Doctor. 
KORBY: No one need ever die again. No disease, no deformities. why even
fear can be programmed away, replaced with joy. I'm offering you a
pracical heaven, a new paradise, and all I need is your help. 
KIRK: All you wanted before was my understanding. 
KORBY: I need transportation to a planet colony with proper raw
materials. I'm sure there are several good possibilities among your
next stops. No diversion from your route. I want no suspicions aroused.
I'll begin producing androids carefully, selectively. 
KIRK: Yes, yes. No one need know, only to frighten uninformed minds. 
KORBY: They must be strongly infiltrated into society before the
android existence is revealed. I want no wave of hysteria to destroy
what is good and right. You with me, Captain? 
KIRK: You've created your own Kirk. Why do you need me? 
KORBY: I created him to impress you, not to replace you. 
KIRK: I'm impressed, Doctor, but not the way you think! (leaps up with
cord he's untied from the chair leg and loops it around Korby's throat)
Stand back, Ruk! I'll kill him! Stay back. (goes through door,
releasing Korby into Ruk's arms) 
KORBY: Ruk, protect! 
CHAPEL: Roger, I. Ruk, no! (runs after him)
[Tunnels]
CHAPEL: Ruk, stop! Doctor Korby said you are to
obey me! Ruk! Ruk! Ruk, I order you not to harm him! 
(Kirk breaks off a stalactite to use as a club. RUk
hears the sound) 
RUK [Chapel's voice]: Captain Kirk, where are you? Captain Kirk! I can
help you! 
KIRK: Christine, is that you? 
(Ruk sneaks up and they struggle, ending up with Kirk dangling from the
edge of the pit. After thinking about it, Ruk pulls him up to safety)
[Corridor]
SPOCK: Captain!
[Bedroom]
SPOCK: Captain, We finished ahead of schedule. 
KIRK2: Doctor Korby has considerable cargo to beam aboard. I'll have to
go over our destination schedule with him. 
SPOCK: You're going back down with the command pack? 
KIRK2: Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your
half-breed interference, do you hear? 
SPOCK: Yes. very well, Captain. 
KIRK2: You look upset, Mister Spock. Is everything all right up here? 
SPOCK: No problems here, sir. 
KIRK2: Good. I'll beam up shortly with Doctor Korby and party.
(leaves) 
SPOCK: Security, Spock here. Status of your landing party? 
SECURITY [OC]: Ready and standing by, sir, 
SPOCK: Have them meet me in the transporter room after the Captain has
beamed down.
[Korby's study]
KIRK2: I looked it over. I think you'll find planet
Midas Five an excellent choice. 
KORBY: A small colony. Abundant raw materials. You made a good
beginning, Captain. 
KIRK2: Thank you. I felt quite at home on the Enterprise.
[Bedroom]
KIRK: Andrea, kiss me. (she does, then raises her
arm to slap him. He stops her and pulls her in for a passionate embrace)
ANDREA: No. Not programmed for you.
KIRK: What's the matter, Andrea? Confused? 
ANDREA: No. (leaves. Ruk blocks Kirk's attempt to leave) 
KIRK: Emotion, Ruk? You disapprove of Miss Chapel's orders to save my
life? 
RUK: To maintain your existence would be illogical.
KIRK: Why? Can't your memory banks solve a simple equation like that?
What happened to the old ones, Ruk? 
RUK: So long ago. 
KIRK: Is it possible they built their machines too well, gave them
pride and a desire to survive? Machines that wanted logic and order and
found that frustrated by the illogical emotional creatures that built
them? 
RUK: Yes, the old ones. The ones who made us. They grew fearful of us.
They began to turn us off. 
KIRK: And isn't it Korby who's creating the same danger to you all over
again? Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that
logic cannot solve. 
RUK: Yes. Yes, it had been so long ago, I had forgotten. The old ones
here. The ones who made us, yes. Yes, it is still in my memory banks.
It became necessary to destroy them. You are inconsistent. You cannot
be programmed. You are inferior. 
KIRK: And Korby?
RUK: You came from the outside. You bring disorder here. 
KIRK: The danger to you is Korby. 
RUK: I was programmed by Korby. I cannot harm him. 
KIRK: The old ones programmed you, too, but it became possible to
destroy them.
RUK: That was the equation! (seizes Kirk) Existence! Survival must
cancel out programming.
KIRK: That's it, Ruk! Logic! You can't protect someone who's trying to
destroy you! 
KORBY: Ruk, I would like 
RUK: You brought him among us. You brought the inferior ones. We had
cleansed ourselves of them. Now you bring the evil back!
KORBY: Ruk, stop! Your programming. (fires phaser, Ruk vanishes) I had
no choice.
[Corridor]
KIRK: You were a man with respect for all things
alive. How can I explain the change in you? If I was to tell Earth I
was in your hands, to tell them what has become (jumps Korby and traps
his arm in a door. The skin tears to reveal electronics)
[Korby's study]
KORBY: It's still me, Christine. Roger. I'm in
here. You can't imagine how it was. I was frozen, dying. My legs were
gone. I was, I had only my brain between life and death. This can be
repaired easier than another man can set a broken finger. I'm still the
same as I was before, Christine, perhaps even better.
CHAPEL: Are you, Roger? 
KORBY: (into comm. unit) Andrea.
ANDREA [OC]: Yes, Doctor. 
KORBY: There's someone in the outer junction. 
KIRK: Spock. He must've got my message. 
ANDREA [OC]: I will find Ruk. 
CHAPEL: But he'll never find us in this maze. 
KORBY: Ruk has been shut off.
[Laboratory]
KORBY [OC]: Get a weapon. Deal with it. Protect.
[Corridor outside laboratory]
ANDREA: I will kiss you.
KIRK2: No. 
ANDREA: You, you will not?
KIRK2: It is illogical. (she disintegrates him)
[Korby's study]
KORBY: I'm the same! A direct transfer. All of me,
human, rational, and without a flaw. 
ANDREA: He freed himself, and I destroyed, (sees Kirk there) destroyed
him. I am not programmed for alarms. I listened to your instructions.
They were mis-stated. 
KIRK: She killed the android, Korby, the same way you killed Ruk. Is
this your perfect world, your flawless beings killing off one another?
Aren't you doing exactly what you hate most in humans, killing with no
more concern than when you turn off a light? 
KORBY: I'm not a computer. Test me. Ask me to solve any, equate,
transmit. Christine, Christine, let me prove myself. Does this make
such a difference?
CHAPEL: Don't you see, Roger? Everything you've done has proved it
isn't you.
KORBY: I am Roger Korby!
KIRK: Then prove it. Give me that phaser gun. If there's any human left
in you, give it to me.
KORBY: No. You will never understand. I constructed a perfect being,
tested it, proved it. Proved it. Proved it? (hands phaser to Kirk) 
KIRK: Andrea, give me the weapon.
ANDREA: No. Protect. Protect. (to Korby) To love you. To, to kiss you. 
KORBY: No. You cannot love. You're not human.
ANDREA: Love you. Kiss. (Korby reaches for trigger and disintegrates
them both)
SPOCK [OC]: Captain Kirk! 
KIRK: In here, Spock.
SPOCK: Captain, are you all right? Nurse? Where's Doctor Korby?
KIRK: Doctor Korby was never here.
[Bridge]
CHAPEL: Thank you for letting me make the decision,
Captain. I'm quite certain I'm doing the right thing. (leaves) 
KIRK: She's staying with the ship. Something bothering you, Mister
Spock?
SPOCK: Frankly, I was rather dismayed by your use of the term
half-breed, Captain. You must admit it is an unsophisticated
expression. 
KIRK: I'll remember that Mister Spock, the next time I find myself in a
similar situation. Steady as we go, helm.

Stardate:
2713.5
Original Airdate: Oct 27, 1966
  {Bridge]
KIRK: Earth-style distress signal. SOS. 
FARRELL: I've answered it on all frequencies, sir. They don't reply. 
SPOCK: Not a vessel, a ground source. The third planet in this solar
system, according to my instruments. 
FARRELL: Directly ahead. Definitely an Earth-style signal. 
KIRK: We're hundreds of light years from Earth, Mister Spock. No
colonies or vessels out this far. 
SPOCK: Measuring the planet now, Captain. It's spheroid-shaped,
circumference twenty four thousand eight hundred seventy four miles.
Mass six times ten to the twenty first power tons. Mean density five
point five one seven. Atmosphere oxygen, nitrogen. 
RAND: Earth! 
KIRK: Not the Earth, another Earth. Another Earth?
Captain's Log, stardate 2713.5. In the distant
reaches of our galaxy, we have made an astonishing discovery. Earth
type radio signals coming from a planet which apparently is an exact
duplicate of the Earth. It seems impossible, but there it is.
[Bridge]
KIRK: Hold us in a fixed orbit, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Affirmative, Captain. 
KIRK: Still no response, communications? 
FARRELL: None, Captain. 
KIRK: We'll beam down. Alert security. Prepare to transport landing
party to surface. We'll land in the vicinity of the distress signals
now being received.
[Street]
KIRK: Identical. Earth, as it was in the early
1900s. 
SPOCK: More the, er, mid-1900s I would say, Captain, approximately
1960. 
RAND: But where is everybody? 
SPOCK: Readings indicate that natural deterioration has been taking
place on this planet for at least several centuries. 
RAND: You mean there's no one alive? 
SPOCK: Not conclusive, Yeoman. The evidence would suggest that the
distress signal is automated. 
MCCOY: Now, this is marvellous. the most horrible conglomeration of
antique architecture I've ever seen. 
KIRK: Mister Spock. (comes upon child's tricycle) 
TEENAGER: Mine! Mine! (attacks McCoy) Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! (Kirk drags him off and hits him several times) It's, it's broke.
Somebody broke it. Fix. Somebody, please fix. 
MCCOY: Of course somebody will fix it. 
SPOCK: Definitely humanoid, in spite of the distortion. 
KIRK: But with the mind of a child. Bones, what is it? 
MCCOY: A seizure of some type. 
KIRK: We want to help you. 
TEENAGER: Liar! Fibber, fibber, fibber, fibber, fibber, fibber, fibber! 
MCCOY: It's dead. It's incredible. 
KIRK: What is? 
MCCOY: Its metabolic rate. It's impossibly high as if it's burning
itself up, almost as if it aged a century in just the past few minutes.
KIRK: (sound of running) Come on!
[House]
KIRK: How old is this thing? 
SPOCK: About three hundred years. 
KIRK: (sound in the closet) Come out. We mean you no harm. (opens door)
MIRI: Don't hurt me, please. 
KIRK: I'm not going to hurt you. 
MIRI: No, please, don't. I didn't do anything. 
KIRK: I won't hurt you. 
MIRI: No, please don't. 
KIRK: I only want to talk to you. 
MIRI: No, don't. Don't hurt. 
KIRK: Come on. 
MIRI: Don't, please. 
KIRK: I won't hurt you. 
MIRI: Don't hurt me. 
KIRK: Come on. It's all right. Come on. 
RAND: We won't hurt you, sweetheart. We're your friends. No, shh! 
KIRK: Take the guards, have a look outside. Radioactive readings,
chemical pollutions, any further sign of life. 
SPOCK: Right, Captain. 
MCCOY: I wonder what happened to her, that she should be so terrified
of us. 
(Someone clears a patch of grime from a window, Spock goes over and
peers in) 
MIRI: But I remember the things you Grups did, burning, yelling,
hurting people. 
KIRK: We didn't do anything like that. 
MIRI: You're not going to hurt? 
KIRK: Well, of course not. We're here to help. 
MIRI: Grups don't help. 
RAND: But we will. 
KIRK: What happened here? Where is everybody? 
MIRI: You know. 
KIRK: No, I don't. Won't you tell me? 
MIRI: You got a foolie, is that it, and you want me to play, but I
can't. I don't know the rules. I've got to know the rules. 
MCCOY: Foolie? 
MIRI: A game, you know. You can't play a game without rules. Even Grups
ought to know that. 
KIRK: What are Grups? 
MIRI: You are. They will, when Onlies get old. 
RAND: Grownups. 
KIRK: You said something about the Grups doing bad things, yelling,
hurting, burning. 
MIRI: That was when they started to get sick in the before time. We
hid, then they were gone. Am I doing all right? 
KIRK: You're doing fine. 
MCCOY: You said the Grups got sick. Is that why there aren't any of
them around? 
MIRI: Yes. They died, but that was after the awful things. 
MCCOY: A plague, Captain. That could explain a lot of it. 
KIRK: But what about the children, the Onlies? Didn't the awful things
affect them? 
MIRI: Of course not. We're here, aren't we? 
KIRK: More of you? How many? 
MIRI: All there are. 
KIRK: What's your name? 
MIRI: Miri. 
KIRK: Miri. A pretty name for a pretty young woman. 
MIRI: Pretty? 
KIRK: Very pretty.
[Alleyway]
SPOCK: Guards! Cover me. 
CHILDREN [OC]: Nyah na nyah. (stones are dropped from above) Nyah na
nyah. Nyah na nyah. Nyah na nyah. Nyah na nyah. Nyah na nyah. Nyah na
nyah. Nyah na nyah. Nyah na nyah. Nyah na nyah!
[House]
SPOCK: Children, Captain. Lots of them. We couldn't
begin to get close to them. They just seemed to scurry away, like
animals. Only children. 
KIRK: Miri said all the adults died. 
MCCOY: That creature which attacked us was certainly no child. Perhaps
it died of the disease the girl's talking about. 
KIRK: There must be records somewhere and answers to some of our
questions. Miri, do you know any buildings where the doctors used to
work? 
MIRI: Yes, I know that. Them and their pills and things. 
KIRK: Will you take me there? 
MIRI: That's a bad place. 
KIRK: It's important. Please. 
MIRI: All right. Do you have a name, too? 
KIRK: Yes. It's Jim. 
MIRI: I like that name. 
KIRK: Good. I like yours, too. I like you. 
MIRI: Do you really? 
KIRK: I wouldn't lie to you. 
MIRI: I wouldn't lie to you, either, Jim. I remember the Grups, but
you're nice. You're different. 
KIRK: Why, thank you. (sees a mark on his hand) 
MIRI: It's already starting. I knew it would. Just like it did with the
Grups. It'll spread all over you, and you'll yell, and you'll try to
hurt everybody and then you'll die. I knew it would! I knew it would!
Captain's Log, stardate 2713.6. The building Miri
led us to also housed an automatic transmission station, which sent out
the signal that drew us to this planet. We also discovered something
else. That the blues
blotches, characteristic of the unknown disease had appeared on each of
us, with the exception of Mister Spock. There was a well-equipped
laboratory in the building.
Doctor McCoy took tissue samples of each of us in an attempt to isolate
the organism responsible.
[Laboratory]
MCCOY: A veritable zoo of bacteria. Beam down a
biocomputer and a portable electronic microscope. If I'm dealing with
viruses, I'll need better equipment than I have here.
[Bridge]
FARRELL: Yes, Doctor. 
[Laboratory]
FARRELL [OC]: Captain Kirk? 
KIRK: Yes, Lieutenant?
[Bridge]
FARRELL: I've got volunteers standing by ready to
help you, sir.
[Laboratory]
KIRK: Under no circumstances do I want anyone to
beam down from the ship. We can't take any chances with further
contamination. 
FARRELL [OC]: But Captain, if you become too ill to 
KIRK: My orders still stand, Lieutenant. You can help us best by
clearing the computer banks and standing by. Kirk out. Bones, why do
you think the symptoms haven't appeared in Mister Spock? 
MCCOY: I don't know. Probably the little bugs or whatever they are have
no appetite for green blood. 
SPOCK: Being a red-blooded human obviously has its disadvantages. Now
there you have a museum piece, Doctor. (referring to microscope) Lens
type, manually operated, light-activated. 
MCCOY: Spare me the analysis, Mister Spock, please. It is enough that
it works. 
MIRI: It spreads real fast. I know. When you're old, it covers you like
anything. 
KIRK: (reading) Intermediate experimentation report project on life
prolongation. 
SPOCK: Progress report, genetics section, Life Prolongation Project. 
RAND: So that's what it was. 
MCCOY: Life prolongation. Didn't have much luck, did they?
Captain's Log. Doctor McCoy's biocomputer and a
portable electronic microscope have been beamed down from the
Enterprise. They will be used in conjunction with computer banks
on-board ship.
[Laboratory]
MCCOY: Tubular with extreme multiplicability.
Appear to have affinity for nucleic acids. Give me what you have. 
SPOCK: This was three hundred years ago, Captain. 
KIRK: All the adults are dead. Only the children are left alive. 
SPOCK: But children become adults. 
KIRK: At least they have up to now. 
SPOCK: Doctor, there are certain glandular changes which take place
upon entering puberty, are there not? 
MCCOY: Of course. It changes the entire body system. You know that. Of
course you know that. Why? 
SPOCK: Is it not possible that these children here, as they enter
puberty, contract the disease? 
KIRK: That would explain why there are no adults. 
MCCOY: Glandular, post-pubescent. Could be. 
SPOCK: It's illogical. It does not follow. All the adults on this
planet died three hundred years ago, but there are children in the
streets. 
KIRK: Who die when they enter adolescence. 
MCCOY: But how do they keep the line going? 
RAND: One thing, Captain. If she were a wild animal ever since she's
been a little girl, how do you explain that she wants to stay with us? 
KIRK: Loneliness? I don't know, curiosity? I think children have an
instinctive need for adults. They want to be told right and wrong. 
SPOCK: There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain. 
MCCOY: She likes you, Jim. 
SPOCK: She's becoming a woman.
[Bridge]
FARRELL: Mister Spock.
[Laboratory]
SPOCK: Spock here. 
FARRELL [OC]: Here are those figures you asked for. Twelve to the tenth
power. Metabolic rate seventy two percent. Production of nucleic acids
reduced to thirty three percent of normal. Conventional chronological
progression one hundred by three point six. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged, Lieutenant. I have their calculations now. 
KIRK: (to redshirts) Try again. See if you can find anything outside.
(to Miri) Hey, clean up that desk for me, will you? 
MIRI: All right, Jim. 
KIRK: Thank you. 
SPOCK: According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought
they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every
one hundred years of real time. 
RAND: One hundred years and only one month? 
SPOCK: Exactly, Yeoman. Evidently through some miscalculation, this
virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period,
leaving only the children. 
RAND: But that means these children 
SPOCK: Could very well be immensely old. 
KIRK: That would certainly answer the question of what happened to
their parents. 
MCCOY: Answers it very well. 
RAND: Children who never age. Eternal childhood, filled with play, no
responsibilities. It's almost like a dream. 
KIRK: I wouldn't examine that dream too closely, Yeoman. It might not
turn out to be very pretty. 
MCCOY: A few days ago or a week ago that creature that attacked us
could have been just like Miri. A child entering puberty on this planet
means a death sentence. 
RAND: Do you suppose she knows? 
KIRK: I don't think so. 
RAND: If they're as old as Spock claims, they must have some idea of
what's happening. 
KIRK: There's no adult interpretation. I think we're dealing with
children. Immensely old perhaps, but nonetheless children.
We've got to do something about the others. 
SPOCK: Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them. 
KIRK: You couldn't get close to the other kids? 
SPOCK: Impossible. They know the area too well, like mice. 
KIRK: I'm going to try. Miri? Come here. You want to go someplace with
me? 
MIRI: Sure. (leave, holding hands) 
RAND: That little girl 
SPOCK: Is at least three hundred years older than you are, Yeoman.
Think about it.
[Old Toy Shop]
JAHN: Miri is with them! Why? Why? 
RED HEAD BOY: What's she going to do, Jahn? 
JAHN: I don't, I don't know. I know what we've got to do. There are
more of them than we see. Somewhere, up in the sky, maybe, somewhere.
They talk to each other all the time. You know Grups. You know what
they do, the hurting, the killing. 
RED HEAD BOY: I remember, Jahn, the way it was. 
JAHN: That's right, the way it was in the before time. They talk to the
other Grups with these little boxes. Now, if they didn't have those
little boxes, they'd be all alone, huh? 
RED HEAD BOY: But they don't see us. We hide. Olly olly oxen free! 
CHILDREN: Olly olly oxen free! Olly olly oxen free! Olly olly oxen
free! 
JAHN: No! It's not a game, it's real. They're dangerous, they're Grups.
Don't you understand? 
MASKED BOY: Jahn! 
JAHN: (sees Kirk and Miri approach the building) All right, let's hide!
(Kirk and Miri come in, then a changing girl appears. The children
flee, screaming. The girl jumps Kirk, and he eventually stuns her) 
KIRK: Dead. I don't understand it. My phaser wasn't set to kill. 
MIRI: Her name was Louise. She was just a little bit older than I am
when it happened. Oh, Jim. (she hugs him)
[Laboratory]
FARRELL [OC]: Data has been fed into the computers,
Mister Spock. Stand by. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged. 
MIRI: (sharpening pencils) Are these enough, Jim? 
KIRK: We could use some more, if you don't mind. 
MIRI: No, I don't mind. 
KIRK: There couldn't be any doubt about what you found here? 
SPOCK: This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the
disaster began. I disregard these last entries. He said himself he was
too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree,
but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we
have. The ship's computers will verify my figures. 
MCCOY: Only a matter of time before we all go mad, destroy each other,
till the last of us finally destroys himself. 
KIRK: What about Miri? 
SPOCK: Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they enter
puberty and their metabolism changes. The notes would indicate it
doesn't become acute for a month or so. I estimate she has perhaps five
or six weeks left. 
MCCOY: What about us? 
SPOCK: The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the
disease. 
KIRK: And you? The disease doesn't seem to be interested in you. 
SPOCK: I am a carrier. Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship,
and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain. 
KIRK: Of course, Mister Spock. We still don't know what we're fighting.
MCCOY: No, but we know what it is and how fast it does it. It's
progressing. We'll begin to feel it inside soon. Intense fever, great
pain in the extremities, fuzziness of vision. Of course, those are the
early symptoms. There'll be more. 
KIRK: Are You certain about the time we have left? 
SPOCK: I presume my calculations are correct. 
KIRK: Is there any possibility 
FARRELL [OC]: Landing party, this is the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
FARRELL [OC]: Computer indicates one hundred seventy hours, Mister
Spock. 
SPOCK: Verified, Captain. We have seven days.
Captain's Log, supplement. This is the second day
of the seven left to us. We've found nothing. Enterprise is standing by
with labs and computers ready to assist us.
[Laboratory]
KIRK: There's no data, no starting point. 
MCCOY: I think I've found it. 
KIRK: Janice, take Miri for a walk. 
RAND: Yes, sir. 
MCCOY: Only one half intact. 
KIRK: But do you know what they were up to? 
MCCOY: More or less. The idea was to create a new series of diseases, a
chain reaction of viruses meant essentially to extend the life of the
human cell immeasurably. 
SPOCK: Unfortunately, they weren't successful. We've seen the results. 
KIRK: You two will have to recreate their thinking. If you can isolate
that virus, we'll be able to develop a vaccine. 
MCCOY: Is that all, Captain? We have five days, you know. 
KIRK: I know. 
CHILDREN [OC]: Nyah na nyah. Nyah na nyah. 
KIRK: The children! (all dash out, while Jahn sneaks in and collects
the communicators from the desks)
[Corridor outside Laboratory]
KIRK: Anything? 
SPOCK: No, nothing. 
KIRK: And you? (clunk as grate closes)
[Laboratory]
SPOCK: Communicators, Captain, they're gone. 
MCCOY: Jim, We've absolutely got to have those communicators. Without
them, we don't have the computers, and without the computers, we don't
have a chance.
Captain's Log, stardate 2717.3. Three days, seven
hours left to us. Investigation proves that the supply of food in the
area
is running dangerously low. Unless something is done, the children will
starve in a few months. The disease is working on each of us according
to Doctor McCoy's prediction. Our tempers are growing short, and We're
no further along than we were two days ago.
[Laboratory]
KIRK: Haven't you found a thing yet? 
MCCOY: Would you like to take a crack at it? 
RAND: (as Kirk pushes past and makes her drop flasks) No! No! No! (runs
out, Kirk follows, then Miri)
[Corridor]
RAND: I'm upset, so upset. Back on the ship, I used
to try to get you to look at my legs. Captain, look at my legs.
(covered in blotches) 
KIRK: (holds her) We're all frightened. (Miri leaves) 
MCCOY [OC]: Jim, I found something!
[Laboratory]
MCCOY: The last slide I examined, I failed to make
the necessary adjustment. The slowing down of my own responses 
KIRK: Never mind that, what did you find? 
MCCOY: The disease, Captain, the one they created three hundred years
ago. 
RAND: There's a chance! 
MCCOY: A chance. At least it's a race now, and we've just wasted a
minute.
[Old Toy shop]
JAHN: That would be some foolie, Miri, but do you
think it would work? 
MIRI: I know. I know. Don't you think I've heard them talk? They have
such little time to do this dumb thing of theirs, this baninski thing.
If we get her away. that Yeoman, that's one person less to start off
with. 
MASKED BOY: But how, Miri? If they're so busy, if they're going to have
the big emergency, how are you going to get her away? 
MIRI: It's easy. She's always asking me about the youngest little
Onlies, little ones. What if they get sick, who takes care of them? Do
they have enough to eat? Where do they sleep? I'll just tell her one of
you fell down and got hurt. 
RED HEAD BOY: Me. Say it's me. 
MIRI: All right, you. 
JAHN: But Grups, they know things and all that. You know, I bet they'll
be able to do it with one person less. 
MIRI: Not one, two. Because he'll try to find her. 
RED HEAD BOY: Who? Who will, Miri? 
MIRI: The Captain. He'll try to find her, but he won't. Mister
Lovey-dovey. 
RED HEAD BOY: Lovey-dovey. Bonk bonk on the head. Bonk bonk! bonk bonk!
CHILDREN: Bonk bonk! Bonk bonk! 
[Laboratory]
MCCOY: It looks right. 
SPOCK: The nitrogen cycle, it has to be. 
MCCOY: But the question is, what's the dosage? 
SPOCK: That is a very good question. 
KIRK: Where is she, Miri? Where is she, Miri? Where's Janice? 
MIRI: What's the matter with you? How should I know? 
KIRK: Where is she? Has something happened to her? 
MIRI: Don't you feel all right? 
KIRK: No, I don't feel all right! None of us feel all right! Can't you
see what's going on? 
MIRI: Jim, I don't want anything to happen to you. 
KIRK: I've got to find Janice. 
SPOCK: That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators. 
KIRK: We're trying, Mister Spock. We're trying very hard. 
MCCOY: That's not good enough! This could be it, but we can't test it
without the ship's computers. 
SPOCK: We've got to have those communicators, Jim. 
KIRK: This is the vaccine? 
MCCOY: That's what the computers will tell us. 
SPOCK: Without them, it could be a beaker full of death. 
KIRK: Did you hear them? We only have a few hours left. 
MIRI: I don't care. 
KIRK: You've got to care. Miri, I'm going to tell you something. You,
your friends, all the Onlies are going to get the disease unless we
succeed in what we're doing. You've seen your friends get it. 
MIRI: Sometimes it happens. 
KIRK: Not sometimes. All the times, Miri! As soon as you start growing
up the way you are. Don't you know why you don't like to play games
anymore, why you don't see your friends the way you used to? It's
because you're becoming a young woman, and the moment you become a
young woman, you get the disease. All of you. 
MIRI: That's not true. It just happens sometimes. 
KIRK: All the time, Miri! It's happening to you right now! Look at it.
Look at it, Miri, it's in you! 
MIRI: No! No! No!
[Schoolroom]
RED HEAD BOY: Blah, blah, blah! 
JAHN: No, you got the wrong game. A teacher, I told you. Now, what does
a teacher say, huh? 
RED HEAD BOY: Yeah. Study, study, study, or bonk bonk, bad kid.
(children all applaud) 
RAND: It's not funny. 
JAHN: It's a foolie. 
RAND: What are you going to do with me? 
JAHN: You think I'd tell you? Miri, you're not supposed to be here. 
MIRI: I know. 
JAHN: What's the matter, something go wrong? 
MIRI: No. 
JAHN: Okay, then. Don't just stand there in the doorway, come on in. 
MIRI: Listen to him. 
JAHN: You listen, Miri. 
MIRI: I did. Why do you think I brought him here? Tell them, Jim. 
JAHN: Tell'em, Jim. Tell'em, Jim. 
CHILDREN: Tell'em, Jim! Tell'em, Jim! Tell'em, Jim! Tell'em, Jim! 
KIRK: Listen to me. Listen to me! 
JAHN: No yelling in the classroom! Look at him, a very bad citizen. 
KIRK: This isn't a game. It never was a game. 
BLONDE GIRL: Call the police! 
RED HEAD BOY: I'm the police. Bonk bonk unless you're good. 
JAHN: You're the teacher. 
RED HEAD BOY: I got two jobs. Bonk bonk! 
CHILDREN: Blah blah blah! Blah blah blah! Blah blah blah! Blah blah
blah! 
KIRK: Listen to me! You've got our communicators, the boxes we talk
into. We need them to talk to the ship. 
RED HEAD BOY: Blah blah blah! 
KIRK: No blah blah blah! Because if we don't talk to the ship, if you
don't help us, there won't be any games anymore. There won't be
anything. Nothing, no Grups, no Onlies, nobody left forever and ever. 
RAND: (sees boy with club coming up behind him) Captain. 
KIRK: Now listen to me. You've got to help us before it's too late. Let
Janice go. Give me those communicators before it's too late. 
CHILDREN: (approaching menacingly) Nyah na nyah, nyah na nyah, nyah na
nyah, nyah na nyah. 
KIRK: You've seen your friends change one by one as they grew up. Did
you ever see one of them not change? One by one, they got the disease,
and they became like,
Iike those creatures you're afraid of, like Louise. One by one they
changed and got the disease. The disease like I've got, like Miri has.
You understand what I'm talking about. You're not babies. We can help
you! 
RED HEAD BOY: Naughty Grup. (starts hitting Kirk) Bonk bonk! Bonk bonk!
MIRI: No, please. No! (the other children join in as the little blonde
girl watches, smiling) 
KIRK: (bleeding) It's waiting for you. It may only be a matter of
months. 
MIRI: Listen to him. He's telling the truth. 
JAHN: He's funny. He thinks he's funny. 
RED HEAD BOY: Bonk bonk! Get him! 
KIRK: Look at my arms! That's what's going to happen to you unless you
let me help you. 
RED HEAD BOY: Bonk bonk! Hit him! 
KIRK: And the little ones. What's going to happen to them after you've
gone, after you've turned into creatures like Louise? Oh, they'll still
be here, but not for long, because the food's all gone. You've eaten
it. Maybe six months left, that's all,
and then nothing left to eat, nobody left to take care of them. They'll
die, too. 
MIRI: Look at my arm, Jahn. It's happening to me. He's telling the
truth. 
JAHN: They're Grups! 
CHILDREN: Bonk bonk! Bonk bonk! Bonk bonk! Bonk bonk! 
KIRK: All right, you want a foolie? All right. I dare you, I
double-dare you. Look at the blood on my face. Now look at your hands.
Blood on your hands. Now who's doing the hurting? Not the Grups, it's
you hurting, yelling, maybe killing, just like the Grups you remember
and creatures you're afraid of. You're acting like them, and you're
going to be just like them unless you let me help you. I'm a Grup, and
I want to help you. I'm begging you, let me help you or there won't be
anything left at all. Please. 
[Laboratory]
MCCOY: We can't wait for those communicators any
longer. 
SPOCK: We must. The vaccine could be fatal. 
MCCOY: The disease certainly is. How long do we have left? Hours,
minutes? How much longer do you want to wait? 
SPOCK: Bickering is pointless. I'll check on the Captain's progress.
(Spock leaves. McCoy picks up the hypospray and injects himself, then
collapses in agony) 
MCCOY: Spock! 
GALLOWAY: Is he dead, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Not yet. 
KIRK: (with children and communicators) Three hours, eleven minutes
left. Thank you, Lieutenant. Keep this channel open. Clear your
computers. What happened to him? 
SPOCK: He injected himself with the vaccine. He was unconscious when I
found him. 
KIRK: Look at his face. 
SPOCK: The blemishes are fading. They're fading. Who will understand
the medical mind? 
JAHN: Is this supposed to be a good thing, Miri? 
MIRI: Of course it is.
[Bridge]
RAND: They were just children. Simply to leave them
there with a medical team 
KIRK: Just children, three hundred years old and more. I've already
contacted Space Central. They'll send teachers, advisers. 
MCCOY: And truant officers, I presume. 
KIRK: They'll be all right. 
RAND: Miri. She really loved you, you know. 
KIRK: Yes. I never get involved with older women, Yeoman. Mister Spock?
SPOCK: Captain? 
KIRK: Full ahead. Warp factor one. 
SPOCK: Warp factor one, Captain.

Stardate:
2715.1 
Original Airdate: 3 Nov, 1966
  [Transporter
room] 
BERKELEY: Ready to beam down. Energise. Energise.
KIRK: Having trouble, gentlemen?
BERKELEY: I just don't understand the problem, sir.
KIRK: You're beaming cargo down to a penal colony, Mister Berkeley.
BERKELEY: Their security force field, sir.
KIRK: U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
WOMAN [OC]: Rehab colony. Come in.
KIRK: Request opening in your force field for beaming down of cargo.
WOMAN [OC]: Enterprise, affirmative. Our security cover is now open.
KIRK: Energise. Any incoming cargo?
BERKELEY: Just one item, sir. Some research material bound for the
Central Bureau of Penology at Stockholm.
WOMAN [OC]: Tantalus cargo ready to beam up.
KIRK: Oh, Mister Berkeley, you might refamiliarise yourself with the
manual on penal colony procedures.
BERKELEY: Immediately, sir.
KIRK: I think you can take the time to lock this up first.
BERKELEY: I'll get a vault assignment. (leaves. The box opens, a man
climbs out and attacks the technician)
Captain's log, stardate 2715.1. Exchanged cargo
with penal colony on Tantalus V. I've departed without going ashore. 
[Bridge]
KIRK: I would like to have met Doctor Adams. Have
you ever been to a penal colony since they started following his
theories?
MCCOY: A cage is a cage, Jim.
KIRK: You're behind the times, Bones. They're more like resort colonies
now.
UHURA: Message, Captain. Switching to speaker.
WOMAN [OC]: Tantalus colony to Enterprise. We are unable to locate one
of our inmates. This is a potentially violent case. Possibly hidden in
the box we beamed up to you. Repeat, unable to locate one of our
inmates. This is a potentially violent case.
KIRK: Enterprise acknowledging. Stand by. Security alert three.
UHURA: Security alert, condition three. All sections go to alert
condition three. We may have an intruder aboard.
[Corridor]
UHURA [OC]: Repeat, all sections to alert condition
three. Intruder aboard.
SECURITY: (to intruder who has swapped overall with technician) Hey,
you from Engineering! (runs) Bridge. Section C, deck fourteen.
[Bridge]
UHURA: Captain, section C deck fourteen, reporting
trouble. Someone in Engineering uniform.
KIRK: Security control, this is the Bridge. Come in.
SPOCK: I have them, Captain. Closing off deck fourteen, search in
progress.
[Corridor]
UHURA [OC]: Security alert, condition three.
(intruder jumps one of the security men) Approximately six foot four
male, early forties. Approach with caution. This man's extremely
dangerous. 
[Bridge]
UHURA: Repeat, approach with extreme caution.
Bridge out.
SPOCK: Negative in the deck area, Captain. He may have gotten out.
Expanding search to adjoining sections.
KIRK: Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
ADAMS [OC]: Tantalus colony. Adams here.
KIRK: Doctor Adams? This is Captain Kirk. It appears we may have an
inmate of yours aboard the ship.
UHURA: Transporter crewman found unconscious, Captain. Cargo case open
and empty.
KIRK: Make that definite, Doctor. He's aboard.
ADAMS [OC]: Terribly sorry, Captain. I take all the blame. Let me
repeat, he's clever as well as extremely violent. Take all possible
precautions.
KIRK: We'll keep you posted, Doctor. Kirk out.
SPOCK: Interesting. Your Earth people glorify organised violence for
forty centuries, but you imprison those who employ it privately.
MCCOY: And, of course, your people found an answer.
SPOCK: We disposed of emotion, Doctor. Where there is no emotion there
is no motive for violence. 
GELDER: Where's the captain? Which one of you is the captain?
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk.
GELDER: My name is Van Gelder. I want asylum.
KIRK: At gunpoint?
GELDER: I want your promise first, your word that you won't take me
back there, to Tantalus.
KIRK: No promises. Give me the weapon.
GELDER: No! No. No, I'm not going back! I'll disable your vessel first.
You choose, Captain. I'll destroy your control panel.
(Gelder is distracted and Spock neck-pinches him)
KIRK: Take him to Sickbay. Reverse course. Head back for Tantalus
colony.
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: Abnormal, of course, but it's not
schizophrenia, tissue damage, or any condition I'm acquainted with,
Jim. And you know after getting him here, it took almost a triple dose
of sedative to put him under.
KIRK: Your report said he was quite talkative.
MCCOY: But not very informative. He claimed one thing, then he seemed
to forget, and then he'd start to claim something else, but always with
just the ring of truth in it. I'd sure like to study this one, Jim.
KIRK: Not our problem, Bones.
GELDER: You smart, button-pushing brass hat. Wash your hands of it. Is
that your system? You're both quite sure of yourselves, aren't you?
Quite expert. Take him back. Let someone else worry about him.
KIRK: What did you say your name was?
GELDER: My name? My name is Simon Van Gelder. (in great pain) I was the
director of, director at the Tantalus colony.
MCCOY: You see what I mean?
GELDER: I was a graduate of, of. I was assistant to Doctor. I knew. I
knew, but they've erased it.
MCCOY: Erased?
GELDER: Edited, adjusted, subverted me, but I won't forget! I won't
forget! You, you're so blind ignorant. You believe I belong back there,
don't you? Dead or alive. Well, I won't let you take me back. I'm not
going! I'll die first! Do you hear? I'm not going! No! No! No.
[Bridge]
KIRK: Estimated arrival at Tantalus?
SPOCK: Fifty seven minutes, thirty seconds, Captain.
KIRK: What's so fascinating?
SPOCK: An identification tape from our ship's library on Doctor Simon
Van Gelder.
KIRK: Doctor Van Gelder?
SPOCK: Doctor Van Gelder, Captain. No mistake. There's a full ID tape
on him.
KIRK: Committed to Tantalus colony when?
SPOCK: Assigned there six months ago as Doctor Adams' associate.
KIRK: Ship to surface, Tantalus colony.
UHURA: Hailing frequency's open, sir.
KIRK: U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
WOMAN [OC]: Tantalus.
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. I'd like to speak to Doctor Adams.
WOMAN [OC]: Stand by, Enterprise.
ADAMS [OC]: Captain Kirk, Doctor Adams here.
KIRK: Doctor Adams, regarding your escaped man
ADAMS [OC]: Is Doctor Van Gelder all right? And your people, no
injuries?
KIRK: No casualties, sir. This man is Doctor Simon Van Gelder?
ADAMS [OC]: Yes, of course. You're certain he's all right? We've been
very concerned. In the violent state he's in
KIRK: No harm to him, sir. We thought you might enlighten us as to his
condition.
ADAMS [OC]: He'd been doing some experimental work, Captain, an
experimental beam we'd hoped might rehabilitate incorrigibles. Van
Gelder felt he hadn't the moral right to expose another man to
something he hadn't tried on his own person.
KIRK: Tragedy, Doctor.
MCCOY: Jim, that doesn't quite ring true.
KIRK: Er, Doctor Adams, please stand by. Explain.
MCCOY: I don't believe him. I can't explain it, but the more I study
that patient
KIRK: You don't believe him, and you can't explain it. Bones, are you
aware that in the last twenty years Doctor Adams has done more to
revolutionise, to humanise prisons and the treatment of prisoners than
all the rest of humanity had done in forty centuries? I've been to
those penal colonies since they've begun following his methods, and
they're not cages anymore.
MCCOY: Jim
KIRK: They're clean, decent hospitals for sick minds.
MCCOY: Jim, listen!
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I suggest you ask Doctor Adams if he wants Van Gelder
returned.
KIRK: Doctor Adams, regarding Van Gelder.
ADAMS [OC]: Yes, Captain. May I inquire about your patrol destinations?
Are you passing near any hospital facilities superior to ours? I'd like
Van Gelder to have the best possible treatment, of course.
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor. I'll take it up with the ship's surgeon. Stand
by. Well, Bones, you've got the ball. You care to recommend a better
place?
MCCOY: There are no superior facilities, he knows that. But that's not
the question. If something unusual is going on down there
KIRK: An assumption, Doctor.
MCCOY: I'm required to enter any reasonable doubts into my medical log.
That requires you to answer in your log. Sorry, Jim.
KIRK: Doctor Adams, this is rather embarrassing. By strict
interpretation of our starship regulation, I'm required to initiate an
investigation of this so that a proper report
ADAMS [OC]: No need to apologise, Captain Kirk. In fact, I'd take it as
a personal favour if you'd beam down and look into it yourself. I'm
sure you realise we don't get too many visitors here. Oh, I, er,
Captain, I would appreciate it if you could come down with a minimum
staff. We're forced to limit outside contact as much as possible.
KIRK: Affirmative, Doctor. I've visited rehab colonies before.
Enterprise out. Find me someone in your department with psychiatric and
penology experience, if possible.
MCCOY: Yes, sir.
Captain's log, stardate 2715.2. Standard orbit,
planet Tantalus V. 
[Bridge]
KIRK: Mission, routine investigation and report as
per ship surgeon's medical log. As for my last entry, it seems I will
get to meet Doctor Adams at last. However, I would have preferred other
circumstances. Sickbay. Report, Doctor.
MCCOY [on monitor]: Van Gelder's still violently agitated, Captain.
KIRK: And you'd prefer to keep him here until I complete my
investigation anyway.
SPOCK: I believe we should, Jim.
MCCOY [on monitor]: Oh, I'm assigning your technical aide, Captain. One
of our psychiatrists does have a background in rehabilitative therapy.
Doctor Noel, standing by in the transporter room now.
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor. Bridge out. Mister Spock.
[Transporter room]
KIRK: Co-ordinates? 
BERKELEY: Locked in, sir. Ready to beam down.
NOEL: Doctor Helen Noel, Captain. We've met. Don't you remember the
science lab Christmas party?
KIRK: Yes, I remember.
NOEL: You dropped in 
KIRK: Yes, yes, I remember.
SPOCK: Problem, Captain?
KIRK: Mister Spock, you tell McCoy that she had better check out as the
best assistant I ever had. Energise.
BERKELEY: Energise.
[Building entrance]
KIRK: In here, I presume, Doctor.
NOEL: Perhaps it would be simpler if you called me Helen, Captain,
since 
KIRK: This is another time, another place, and another situation.
NOEL: Of course, Captain.
[Turbolift]
KIRK: Elevator, and going down quite a ways.
NOEL: (in his arms) I wouldn't recommend it for weak hearts.
[Adam's study]
ADAMS: Hello Captain Kirk, and er
KIRK: Doctor Helen Noel. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, sir.
ADAMS: Thank you. Thank you, Captain. Welcome to Devil's Island, Doctor.
NOEL: Perhaps you'll call me Helen, Doctor. With so many titles around,
we're not going to be sure who's talking to who.
ADAMS: I shall indeed. Won't you?
NOEL: Thank you.
KIRK: I believe regulations call for me to check my weapon.
ADAMS: No, no. That won't be necessary in your case, Captain. Just keep
it out of sight, hmm? I know you people feel as naked without a weapon
as we do without a medikit. A small toast. Do you mind? It's such a
great day for us here on Tantalus when we have visitors, no matter what
the excuse.
KIRK: Doctor.
ADAMS: Oh, now, Captain, you made your apology from upstairs. Now
forget it. I don't think you'll be able to get through the security
screen, Captain. Just a second, hmm? There. Now try it.
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
SPOCK [OC]: Enterprise. Spock here.
KIRK: Your landing co-ordinates were right on the nose, Mister Spock.
We arrived safely, and we're here with Doctor Adams right now. Kirk out.
SPOCK [OC]: Affirmative, Captain. Enterprise out. 
ADAMS: Ah, Lethe, come in. Lethe, this is Captain Kirk and Doctor Helen
Noel. Lethe came to us for rehabilitation and stayed on as a therapist,
and a very good one too, I might add.
LETHE: I love my work.
ADAMS: Go right ahead, Captain.
KIRK: Before you came here 
LETHE: I was another person, malignant, hateful.
KIRK: May I ask what crime you committed?
LETHE: Does it matter? That person no longer exists.
ADAMS: Um, part of our cure, if you will, Captain, is to bury the past.
Why should a person go on living with unbearable memories if there's no
necess. Oh, I feel quite sure that you'd concur with me in that,
Doctor. Helen.
NOEL: A shifting of memory patterns is basic to psychotherapy.
ADAMS: Yes. And now to the toast, hmm? You'll forgive us, Lethe. There
you are, Captain. To all mankind. May we never find space so vast,
planets so cold, heart and mind so empty that, that we cannot fill them
with love and warmth.
[Corridor]
KIRK: Quite a tour, Doctor. Very impressive.
ADAMS: Thank you. Hi, Carl.
[Treatment room]
KIRK: Doctor.
ADAMS: Yes? 
KIRK: Hmm?
ADAMS: Ah. I was afraid you would ask about this, Captain. One doesn't
like to talk about their personal failures, you know? It was just an
experiment that went wrong, I'm afraid.
KIRK: May I see it?
NOEL: Captain, if something hasn't worked out and therefore has no
scientific fact
KIRK: Shall we leave it up to the doctor?
NOEL: Since you brought me down here for advice, Captain
KIRK: One of the advantages of being a Captain, Doctor, is being able
to ask for advice without necessarily having to take it.
ADAMS: I think I'll have to award that round to the Captain, Helen.
You're fighting over your weight. All right, let's take a look.
[Sickbay]
GELDER: I'm not a criminal! I do not require neural
neutraliser. 
SPOCK: Neural neutraliser. Can you explain that, Doctor Van Gelder? 
GELDER: A room. A device. Door. Control panel. I see it. A device. A
light! The light!
SPOCK: This room. What happens there?
GELDER: (screams)
[Treatment room]
 ADAMS: A neural neutraliser. Experimental.
Actually, we don't expect to get much use out of it at all. That beam
from above neutralises brain waves, relaxes the patient's mind. Does
them no harm, of course, and the effects are only temporary.
KIRK: One question, Doctor. If it doesn't do any good 
ADAMS: Why do we go on using it, hmm, Captain? Hope. Yes, yes, there's
always that slight chance that it might do some good in the more
violent cases. 
NOEL: Tranquillisers are fine, Captain, but to continually pump
chemicals into a person's bloodstream 
ADAMS: Exactly my point, Helen. Yes. Shall we? (he and Noel leave) 
KIRK: (to therapist) How does it work? 
THERAPIST: Quite simple. Off on switches, and the large control here
changes the strength of the brain neutralising beam.
ADAMS: Captain, you remind me of the ancient sceptic who demanded of
the wise old sage to be taught all the world's wisdom while standing on
one foot.
NOEL: Beam neutralising has been experimented with on Earth, Captain.
I'm not acquainted with this particular style of equipment, but I can
assure you that Doctor Adams has not created a chamber of horrors here.
KIRK: I didn't mean to suggest that he had. The reason I asked, sir,
was you haven't mentioned where Doctor Van Gelder's injury occurred.
ADAMS: Right here, Captain. Yes, Simon was a very stubborn man. He
could've sat in that room for years with the beam at that volume or
even higher. Or if he simply had someone standing by to snap it off in
case he got into trouble, but, but no. He tried it alone and on full
volume. It's a pity.
KIRK: (to therapist) Thank you. (leaves) 
THERAPIST: (to man in treatment chair) You will forget all you have
heard. To remember any portion of it, any word, will cause you pain,
terrible pain, growing more terrible as you fight to remember.
[Sickbay]
SPOCK: Can you give us your present location,
Captain? 
KIRK [OC]: In Doctor Adams' study, Mister Spock. Why? 
SPOCK: Then you're with Doctor Adams now.
KIRK [OC]: Affirmative.
SPOCK: Captain, Van Gelder has made reference to a particular treatment
room. The term was neural neutraliser.
[Adam's study]
KIRK: Yes. He was injured there. I've seen the
room. Doctor Adams explained 
[Sickbay]
KIRK [OC]: the mistake Van Gelder made.
[Adam's study]
KIRK: Go ahead, Mister Spock. Anything further? 
ADAMS: Your Mister Spock sounds like a very excellent second in
command, Captain Kirk. Please tell him to go ahead and speak freely. I
have to check in with a member of my staff anyway.
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor Adams. 
ADAMS: Excuse me.
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Spock. Doctor Adams has left with some things to
attend to. What is it, Mister Spock?
[Sickbay]
SPOCK: Van Gelder is extremely agitated, Captain,
and warns that you are in danger.
[Adam's study]
NOEL: Oh, that's foolish. 
SPOCK [OC]: Please repeat, Captain. I didn't receive that.
KIRK: Tell McCoy the technical expert he sent along with me insists
that any concern is unjustified. According to Adams, Van Gelder created
his own problem. 
NOEL: He's suffering from 
[Sickbay]
NOEL [OC]: neuro-synapse damage, as if his brain
were short-circuited. It's no wonder he's having delusions.
MCCOY: McCoy here. Received and understood. 
[Adam's study]
MCCOY [OC]: But we still have some doubts up here,
Captain. Can you tell us any more?
KIRK: Not really. 
SPOCK: When do you plan to beam back up, Captain?
KIRK: I think we'll spend the night here, Mister Spock.
[Sickbay]
GELDER: No! No, no, no.
SPOCK: And you will continue to check in every four hours?
KIRK [OC]: Affirmative. 
[Adam's study]
KIRK: Kirk out.
[Sickbay]
GELDER: No! No. No, don't let them! You must warn
your captain. No! No! Don't let him stay! Don't let him stay! Don't!
No. No. Don't hypo me. Please, don't hypo me. I'll try not to fight.
I'll try. But you must listen. Warn your Captain. Doctor Adams. Doc,
Doctor Adams will destroy.
SPOCK: Destroy how? What? 
GELDER: Right death.
SPOCK [OC]: Enterprise log. First officer Spock,
acting captain. I must now use an ancient Vulcan technique to probe
into Van Gelder's tortured mind.
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: Spock, if there's the slightest possibility
it might help. 
SPOCK: I've never used it on a human, Doctor. 
MCCOY: If there's any way we can look into this man's mind to see if
what he's seeing is real or delusion
SPOCK: It's a hidden, personal thing to the Vulcan people, part of our
private lives.
MCCOY: Now look, Spock, Jim Kirk could be in real trouble. Will it work
or not?
SPOCK: It could be dangerous. Do you understand? It requires I make
pressure changes in your nerves, your blood vessels.
GELDER: You must open my mind. Let me warn you and explain to you.
SPOCK: This will not affect you, Doctor McCoy, only the person I touch.
It is not hypnosis.
MCCOY: I understand. (Spock puts his hands on Gelder's face) Good, the
reading's levelling.
SPOCK: You begin to feel a strange euphoria. Your body floats.
GELDER: Yes, I begin to feel it.
SPOCK: Open your mind. We move together. Our minds sharing the same
thoughts.
[Noel's room]
KIRK: Good evening.
NOEL: Good evening.
KIRK: What did you think of the inmates we saw here this afternoon?
NOEL: You could've waited until tomorrow morning to ask me that,
Captain.
KIRK: I didn't.
NOEL: I thought they were happy, well-adjusted.
KIRK: But a bit blank.
NOEL: Captain, if you're questioning the methods of a man like Tristan
Adams
KIRK: I'd like to see that treatment room again. You say you're
somewhat familiar with the theory behind it? 
NOEL: Yes, somewhat, but if you'd simply state any doubts you have to
Doctor Adams
KIRK: And if he's lying, he'll continue to lie, and I won't find out a
thing. The only way I can be sure is to see that machine at work, or is
that too impractical and unscientific of me, Doctor? Well?
NOEL: Coming.
[Sickbay]
SPOCK: What is our name? Who are we?
GELDER: We are Simon Van Gelder.
SPOCK: Doctor Adams. The neural neutraliser. What did he do to us?
GELDER: He can reshape any mind he chooses. He used it to erase our
memories, put his own thoughts there. He was surprised it took so much
power. We fought him, remember? But we grew so tired, our minds so
blank, so open, that any thought he placed there became our thoughts.
Our minds so empty like a sponge, needing thoughts, begging. Empty.
Loneliness. So lonely to be sitting there empty, wanting any word from
him. Love.
SPOCK: Yes.
GELDER: Hate.
SPOCK: Yes.
GELDER: Live.
SPOCK: Yes.
GELDER: Die.
SPOCK: Yes.
GELDER: Such agony to be empty.
SPOCK: Empty.
GELDER: Lonely.
SPOCK: Lonely.
GELDER: So empty.
SPOCK: Empty.
GELDER: So empty.
[Treatment room]
KIRK: I have no desire to damage my brain. Can this
be handled with reasonable safety? Yes or no?
NOEL: Yes.
KIRK: And will you be able to determine if that beam is harming me in
the slightest?
NOEL: Yes, Captain. I know my profession. (Kirk sits in treatment
chair) Ready?
KIRK: Mm-hmm.
NOEL: We'll try minimum intensity, a second or two. (light turns) 
KIRK: Anytime you're ready, Doctor, just for a second or two.
NOEL: We already tried it for that long, Captain.
KIRK: Nothing happened. 
NOEL: Something happened. Your face went completely blank.
KIRK: Try a harmless suggestion.
NOEL: (light turns) You're hungry.
KIRK: You know, when we finally get through this I'd like to locate and
raid a kitchen somewhere.
NOEL: I put that suggestion in your mind, Captain. I said simply that
you were hungry.
KIRK: Remarkably effective for a device that Doctor Adams was going to
abandon.
NOEL: I think we should try this again.
KIRK: Yes. Pick something unusual, an unusual suggestion, something we
can both be sure of.
NOEL: (light turns) At the Christmas party, we met, we danced, you
talked about the stars. I suggest now that it happened in a different
way. You swept me off my feet and carried me to your cabin.
[Kirk's quarters]
KIRK: Merry Christmas.
NOEL: Captain, if your crew saw you carry me here.
KIRK: My crew is sworn to secrecy.
NOEL: But my reputation. I mean, just having met like this. Of course,
it would be different if you cared for me.
KIRK: You want me to manufacture a lie, wrap it up as a Christmas
present for you?
NOEL: No, I prefer honesty. (they kiss)
[Treatment room]
ADAMS: Now Captain Kirk is going to have a complete
demonstration. I want there to be no doubts whatsoever in his mind.
Mmm. You're madly in love with Helen, Captain. You'd lie, cheat, steal
for her, sacrifice your career, your reputation.
NOEL: No, Doctor! No! 
ADAMS: The pain. Do you feel it, Captain? You must have her, or the
pain grows worse, the pain, the longing for her.
KIRK: Helen.
NOEL: No. 
ADAMS: For years, you've loved her, Captain, for years.
KIRK: For years, I've loved you. 
ADAMS: You must continue to remember that, Captain. And now, she's
gone. (machine to maximum) 
KIRK: Helen! Helen, don't go! I need you, Helen! 
ADAMS: (reduces intensity) Now Captain, you must take your phaser
weapon and drop it on the floor. Captain, the pain increases unless you
obey me.
KIRK: I must drop it.
ADAMS: Very good, Captain. Very good indeed. And now your communicator.
Drop it on the floor. 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Argh! (machine to maximum) Kirk to
Enterprise. Argh!
NOEL: No!
[Kirk's room]
NOEL: They've taken you from the room, Captain.
You're in your own quarters now.
KIRK: Helen. Helen, for years I've loved you. Helen. 
NOEL: Try to remember.
KIRK: I've loved you.
NOEL: He placed all that in your mind. 
KIRK: For years.
NOEL: Remember. Doctor Adams took the controls away from me. Do you
remember the pain and then his voice? Remember?
KIRK: Yes. Yes, I remember. I remember. Helen. Look. The duct. The
duct. Give me a hand here. Pull. (cover comes open) Air conditioning.
It has to connect with other ducts and tunnels. You can get through
this. It might lead to the power supply. Short-circuited, it would cut
off the security force field. Have you had any training in hyper-power
circuits?
NOEL: No.
KIRK: Megavoltage. Touch the wrong line, and you're dead.
NOEL: Anything's better than Adams' treatment room. (he closes the
cover behind her and the door opens) Time for another treatment?
[Treatment room]
ADAMS: Please don't fight me, Captain. The pain
only gets worse when you doubt me. You believe in me completely.
KIRK: I believe in you. 
ADAMS: You trust me completely. 
KIRK: I trust you.
ADAMS: Excellent, Captain. I compliment you. Do you know Doctor Van
Gelder was down on his hands and knees sobbing at this point? It was so
gratifying. I'm so fortunate to have had a couple of excellent
specimens to, to work with. I've learned a great deal.
LETHE: The woman doctor. She's gone, Doctor Adams. 
ADAMS: Notify security at once, Lethe. Where is she, Captain?
KIRK: I, argh, I don't know.
ADAMS: Where is Helen And with what instructions?
KIRK: I don't know. (collapses)
(Noel makes it to the power control room and finds an off switch but it
won't move)
[Transporter room]
SPOCK: Emergency channel D.
BERKELEY: It's no good, Mister Spock. I can't break through their force
field.
SPOCK: Keep trying.
(Noel hides as guards search for her, and when they go she pulls down
the master high voltage switch. A guard grabs her)
[Treatment room]
ADAMS: Put him back in the chair, Eli, and find
that girl. (Kirk knocks them both out and leaves)
(the guard turns the power back on again, but when he reaches for Noel
she pushes him against the high volt grid and he fries, cutting the
power again)
[Transporter room]
BERKELEY: Mister Spock, the force field is gone. I
can send you right to the source of the interruption.
SPOCK: (to McCoy) Get some security people and follow me down.
Energise.
[Power control room]
(Noel dashes back into the aircon tunnels) 
SPOCK: (pushes a load of buttons) Enterprise, this is Spock. Force
field has been eliminated. (turns main power back on again)
[Kirk's room]
NOEL: Captain. Captain? 
KIRK: (helps her out of vent) Helen, are you all right? (kisses her) 
NOEL: Yes. This isn't right, Captain. (Spock enters) Doctor Adams did
this to you. 
KIRK: Doctor Adams? Doctor A. The treatment room. Follow me.
[Treatment room]
MCCOY: Jim! (Kirk turns machine off) 
KIRK: The power came on. 
MCCOY: He's dead, Captain.
NOEL: The machine wasn't on high enough to kill. 
KIRK: But he was alone. Can you imagine the mind emptied by that thing?
Without even a tormentor for company.
NOEL: I understand.
[Bridge]
UHURA: Oh, Captain, there was a message from
Tantalus colony, sir. 
SPOCK: It was from Van Gelder. He thought you'd like to know the
treatment room had been dismantled and the equipment destroyed.
KIRK: Thank you.
MCCOY: It's hard to believe that a man could die of loneliness.
KIRK: Not when you've sat in that room. Take us out of orbit, Mister
Spock. Ahead warp factor one.
SPOCK: Acknowledged, Captain. Warp factor one.

Original Airdate: 10 Nov, 1966
  [Bridge]
SPOCK: One degree to overlap. Stand by to
photograph. Now.
BAILEY: Three days of this now, sir. Other ships must have made star
maps of some of this. 
SPOCK: Negative, Lieutenant. We are the first to reach this far.
SULU: Sir, contact with an object. It's moving toward us. No visual
contact yet.
SPOCK: Deflectors, full intensity.
SULU: It's coming at light speed.
BAILEY: Collision course.
SPOCK: Evasive maneuvers, Mister Sulu.
SULU: Object changing direction, too, sir. Keeps coming at us.
UHURA: I'm getting no signal from it, sir.
BAILEY: Still collision course. Deflectors aren't stopping it.
SPOCK: Sound alarm.
SULU: It's slowing down, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Countermand alarm. All engines full stop.
BAILEY: Visual contact.
SPOCK: Ahead slow. Steer a course around it, Mister Sulu.
BAILEY: It's blocking the way!
SPOCK: Quite unnecessary to raise your voice, Mister Bailey. All
engines stop. Sound the alert.
SULU: Bridge to all decks. Condition alert. All decks, condition alert.
Captain Kirk to the Bridge.
Captain's Log, star date 1512.2. On our third day
of star mapping, an unexplained cubical object blocked our vessel's
path. On the Bridge, Mister Spock immediately ordered general alert. My
location, Sickbay. Quarterly physical check.
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: Just a few seconds more.
KIRK: (on back, pumping pedals) Just a few seconds more.
MCCOY: That's a boy. Keep it up. Work up a little sweat, it'll will do
you good. (notices red alert)
KIRK: You're killing me. You're killing me.
MCCOY: Stop. Winded?
KIRK: You'd be the last one I'd tell. (sees light, goes to desk
monitor) Kirk here. What's going on?
SPOCK [on monitor]: Have a look at this, Captain.
KIRK: What's that?
SPOCK [OC]: Undetermined. Whatever it is, it's blocking our way. When
we move, it moves as well.
KIRK: A vessel of some kind?
SPOCK [OC]: Negative. More some type of device.
KIRK: I'll be right up. You could see the alarm lights flashing from
there, McCoy. Why didn't you tell me?
MCCOY: Finally finished a physical on you, didn't I. (Kirk leaves) What
am I, a doctor or a moon shuttle conductor? If I jumped every time a
light came on around here, I'd end up talking to myself.
[Corridor]
SULU [OC]: All decks alert. All decks alert.
[Turbolift]
KIRK: Bridge. Captain to Bridge.
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here.
KIRK: Any changes?
SPOCK [OC]: Negative. Whatever it is, it seems to just want to hold us
here.
KIRK: Any indication of danger from it?
SPOCK [OC]: Negative.
KIRK: I'll change first then. Captain out.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: All decks have reported green, Mister Bailey.
BAILEY: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: And when the Captain arrives he will expect a full report on 
BAILEY: The cube's range and position. I'll have it by then. Raising my
voice back there doesn't mean I was scared or couldn't do my job. It
means I happen to have a human thing called an adrenaline gland.
SPOCK: It does sound most inconvenient, however. Have you considered
having it removed?
BAILEY: Very funny.
SULU: You try to cross brains with Spock, he'll cut you to pieces every
time.
[Kirk's quarters]
KIRK: Captain to Bridge.
SPOCK [on monitor]: Spock here.
KIRK: Any signs of life?
SPOCK [on monitor]: Negative.
KIRK: Have you tried all hailing frequencies?
SPOCK [on monitor]: Affirmative. No answer from the cube.
KIRK: Have the department heads meet me on the Bridge. 
SPOCK [on monitor]: Already standing by.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Reporting, sir. Sensors show it is solid,
but its composition is unknown to us.
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura.
UHURA: Hailing frequencies still open, sir. I get no message from it.
KIRK: Navigation.
BAILEY: Distance from us, fifteen hundred ninety three metres, position
constant.
SULU: Each of its edges measures one hundred seven metres. Mass, a
little under eleven thousand metric tons.
KIRK: Scotty. 
SCOTT: Motive power? Beats me what makes it go.
KIRK: I'll buy speculation.
SCOTT: I'd sell it if I had any. That's a solid cube. How something
like that can sense us coming, block us, move when we move, well it
beats me. That's my report.
KIRK: Life sciences.
MCCOY: Same report.
BAILEY: Sir, we going to just let it hold us here? We've got phaser
weapons. I vote we blast it. 
KIRK: I'll keep that in mind, Mister Bailey, when this becomes a
democracy.
Captain's Log, star date 1513.8. Star maps reveal
no indication of habitable planets nearby. Origin and purpose of the
cube still unknown. We've been here, held motionless, for eighteen
hours.
[Briefing room]
KIRK: Anything further, gentlemen?
SPOCK: I believe it adds up to either one of two possibilities. First,
a space buoy of some kind. 
KIRK: Second?
SPOCK: Flypaper.
KIRK: And you don't recommend sticking around.
SPOCK: Negative. It would make us appear too weak.
KIRK: It's time for action, gentlemen. Mister Bailey 
BAILEY: Bridge to Phaser Gun Crew
KIRK: Countermand. I'll select what kind of action.
BAILEY: I'm sorry, sir. I thought you meant 
KIRK: Are you explaining Mister Bailey? I haven't requested an
explanation. Now, as I was about to say, Navigator, plot us a spiral
course away from the cube.
BAILEY: Yes, sir. We'll try pulling away from it.
SULU: Yes, sir. Helmsman to Engine Room, stand by. All decks alert.
We're going to try pulling away.
[Bridge]
BAILEY: Course plotted and laid in, sir.
KIRK: Engage, Mister Sulu. Quarter speed.
SULU: Point two five, sir. Still blocking us, sir.
KIRK: Let's see if it'll give way. Ahead half speed.
SULU: Point five oh, sir.
SPOCK: Radiation from the short end of the spectrum increasing.
KIRK: All stop. Hold position.
BAILEY: It's still coming toward us. Range, one hundred ninety metres.
SPOCK: Radiation increasing.
KIRK: Power astern, half speed.
SULU: Half speed.
SPOCK: Radiation nearing the tolerance level.
BAILEY: Still coming, gaining on us.
KIRK: Engines astern, full speed.
SULU: Full speed.
BAILEY: Range one hundred twenty five metres now.
KIRK: Helm, give us warp speed.
SULU: Warp one, sir.
SPOCK: Radiation at the tolerance level.
SULU: Warp two, sir. Speed is now warp three.
SPOCK: Radiation passing the tolerance level, entering lethal zone.
BAILEY: Range fifty one metres and still closing, sir.
KIRK: Phaser Crew stand ready.
BAILEY: Phaser Crew reports ready, sir.
SPOCK: Growing. We can take only a few more seconds of this.
KIRK: Lock phasers on target. Mister Bailey, lock phasers. 
BAILEY: Phasers locked on target, sir. At point-blank range and closing.
KIRK: Fire main phasers.
Captain's Log, star date 1514.0. The cube has been
destroyed. Ship's damage minor but my next decision, major. Probe on
ahead or turn back.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Nothing, Captain. No contacts, no objects in
any direction.
KIRK: Care to speculate on what we'll find if we go on ahead?
SPOCK: Speculate? No. Logically, we'll discover the intelligence which
sent out the cube.
KIRK: Intelligence different from ours or superior?
SPOCK: Probably both, and if you're asking the logical decision to make
KIRK: No, I'm not. The mission of the Enterprise is to seek out and
contact alien life.
SPOCK: Has it occurred to you that there's a certain inefficiency in
constantly questioning me on things you've already made up your mind
about?
KIRK: It gives me emotional security. Navigator, set a course ahead.
BAILEY: Plotted. Laid in, sir.
KIRK: Engage.
BAILEY: Warp one, sir.
KIRK: Mister Bailey, phaser crews were sluggish. You were slow in
locking them into your directional beam. Helmsman, engineering decks
could have been faster, too. Programme a series of simulated attacks
and evasion maneuvers. Keep repeating the exercise until we're
proficient, gentlemen.
SULU: Yes, sir.
BAILEY: Yes, sir.
MCCOY: Your timing is lousy, Jim. 
[Turbolift]
MCCOY: Your men are tired.
KIRK: Captain's quarters. Aren't you the one who always says a little
suffering is good for the soul?
MCCOY: I never say that.
BAILEY [OC]: This is the Bridge. Prepare for simulated attack.
MCCOY: I'm especially worried about Bailey. Navigator's position's
rough enough for a seasoned man.
KIRK: I think he'll cut it.
MCCOY: Oh? How so sure? Because you spotted something you liked in him,
something familiar, like yourself say about, oh, eleven years ago?
BAILEY [OC]: On the double, deck five! Give me a green light.
KIRK: Why, Doctor, you've been reading your textbooks again?
MCCOY: I don't need textbooks to know you could've promoted him too
fast. Listen to that voice.
BAILEY [OC]: Condition alert. Battle stations. 
[Kirk's quarters]
BAILEY [OC]: Engineering, deck five, report. Phaser
crews, come on, let's get with it. Phaser station two, where's your
green light?
KIRK: What's next? They're not machines, Jim?
MCCOY: Well, they're not. After what they've been through they really
should 
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, I've heard you say that man is ultimately superior
to any mechanical device.
MCCOY: No, I never say that, either.
KIRK: I could've sworn I heard you say that. Kirk here.
SPOCK [OC]: Exercise rating, Captain. Ninety four percent.
KIRK: Let's try for one hundred, Mister Spock.
SPOCK [OC]: Agreed.
MCCOY: What are you going to do with that six percent when they give it
to you, Jim?
KIRK: I'm going to take it, and I'm going to (door opens)
RAND: Excuse me, sir. It's past time you had something to eat, sir.
KIRK: What the devil is this? Green leaves?
RAND: It's dietary salad, sir. Doctor McCoy ordered your diet card
changed. I thought you knew.
MCCOY: Your weight was up a couple of pounds, remember?
KIRK: Will you stop hovering over me, Yeoman?
RAND: Well, I'll change it if you don't like it, sir.
KIRK: Bring some for the doctor, too.
MCCOY: No, no. No, I never eat until the crew eats.
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman.
RAND: You're welcome, sir. (leaves)
BAILEY [OC]: This is the Bridge. All decks prepare to better reaction
time on second simulated attack.
KIRK: When I find the headquarters genius that assigned me a female
yeoman
MCCOY: What's the matter, Jim. Don't you trust yourself?
KIRK: I've already got a female to worry about. Her name's the
Enterprise.
BAILEY [OC]: Engineering decks alert. Phaser crews, let's
SULU [OC] Countermand that. All decks to battle stations. This is not a
drill. Repeat, this is not a drill.
KIRK: Kirk here.
SPOCK [OC]: We're picking up an object, sir. Much larger, coming toward
us.
KIRK: Coming.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Exceptionally strong contact. Not visual
yet. Distant spectrograph. Metallic, similar to cube. Much greater
energy reading.
SULU: There, sir.
KIRK: Half speed. Prepare for evasive action.
SULU: Reducing to warp two, sir.
SPOCK: Tractor beam, Captain. Something's grabbed us, hard.
SULU: Engines overloading, sir.
KIRK: All engines stop.
SULU: All engines stopped, sir.
KIRK: Phaser crews stand ready.
BAILEY: Bridge to phaser crews, stand ready.
CREWMAN [OC]: Forward phaser, will comply. All weapons at operational
ready.
SPOCK: Fascinating.
KIRK: What's its mass, Mister Spock?
SPOCK: Reading goes off my scale, Captain. Must be a mile in diameter.
BAILEY: Over five thousand metres away, and it still fills the screen.
KIRK: Reduce image. Let me see all of it.
SULU: Magnification two five, sir. Magnification one eight point five,
sir.
KIRK: Ship to ship.
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.
KIRK: This is the United Earth ship Enterprise. We convey greetings and
await your reply. What is it, Mister Bailey?
BAILEY: A message coming over my navigation beam.
KIRK: Pick it up.
UHURA: Switching, sir.
BALOK [OC]: And trespassed into our star systems. This is Balok,
Commander of the flagship Fesarius of the First Federation. Your
vessel, obviously the product of a primitive and savage civilisation,
having ignored a warning buoy and having then destroyed it, has
demonstrated your intention is not peaceful. We are now considering the
disposition of your ship and the life aboard.
KIRK: Ship to ship.
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.
KIRK: This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. The warning
nature of your space buoy was unknown to us. Our vessel was blocked.
When we attempted to disengage
SPOCK: Captain, we're being invaded by exceptionally strong sensor
probes everywhere. Our electrical systems, our engines.
BALOK [OC]: No further communication will be accepted. If there is the
slightest hostile move, your vessel will be destroyed immediately.
SPOCK: They're shutting off some of our systems, Captain. Brilliant.
Extremely sophisticated in their methods.
KIRK: Does the recorder marker have this on its tapes?
SPOCK: Enough to warn other Earth ships.
KIRK: Mister Bailey, dispatch recorder marker. Mister Bailey?
BAILEY: Recorder marker dispatched, sir.
SPOCK: Marker on course. Heading back the way we (big bang)
BALOK [OC]: Your recorder marker has been destroyed. You have been
examined. Your ship must be destroyed. We make assumption you have a
deity or deities or some such beliefs which comfort you. We therefore
grant you ten Earth time periods known as minutes to make preparations.
SPOCK: Might be interesting to see what they look like if I can locate
where that voice is coming from. (McCoy and Scott enter) 
MCCOY: Balok's message. It was heard all over the ship.
KIRK: Captain to crew. Those of you who have served for long on this
vessel have encountered alien lifeforms. You know the greatest danger
facing us is ourselves, an irrational fear of the unknown. But there's
no such thing as the unknown, only things temporarily hidden,
temporarily not understood. In most cases we have found that
intelligence capable of a civilisation is capable of understanding
peaceful gestures. Surely a lifeform advanced enough for space travel
is advanced enough to eventually understand our motives. All decks
stand by. Captain out. Ship to ship.
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.
KIRK: This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise. We came seeking
friendship but we have no wish to trespass. To demonstrate our
goodwill, our vessel will now return the way it came. We (humming
noise) Lay in a course ahead, Mister Bailey.
BAILEY: What? A course?
SULU: Plotted and laid in, sir.
KIRK: Engage, warp factor one.
SULU: Warp factor. There's no response.
KIRK: Switch to impulse.
SULU: All engine systems show dead, and weapon systems.
SPOCK: Switching to screen. I believe I can get something visual.
BALOK [on viewscreen]: You are wasting time and effort. There is no
escape. You have eight Earth minutes left.
SPOCK: I was curious to see how they appeared.
KIRK: Yes, of course you were.
BAILEY: I don't understand this. Spock's wasting time. Everybody else
just sitting around. Somebody's got to do something.
MCCOY: Easy, Bailey.
BAILEY: What do they want from us? Let's find out what they want us to
do.
KIRK: They want us to lose our heads.
BAILEY: We've only got eight minutes left.
SULU: Seven minutes and forty five seconds.
BAILEY: He's doing a countdown!
MCCOY: Practically end of watch.
BAILEY: What, are you all out of your minds? End of watch? It's the end
of everything. What are you, robots? Wound-up toy soldiers? Don't you
know when you're dying? Watch and regulations and orders What do they
mean?
KIRK: Bailey, you're relieved! Escort him to his quarters, Doctor.
MCCOY: Let's go. (McCoy and Bailey leave) 
KIRK: Ship to ship.
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.
KIRK: This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. It is the custom
of Earth people to try and avoid misunderstanding whenever possible. We
destroyed your space buoy as a simple act of self-preservation. When we
attempted to move away from it, it emitted radiation harmful to our
species. If you've examined our ship and its tapes, you know this to be
true. (humming noise) 
BALOK [on viewscreen]: You now have seven minutes left.
SULU: Four minutes, thirty seconds.
SCOTT: You have an annoying fascination for timepieces, Mister Sulu.
SPOCK: Jim.
BALOK [OC]: Four minutes.
KIRK: What's the matter with them out there? They must know we mean
them no harm. 
SPOCK: They're certainly aware by now that we're totally incapable of
it.
KIRK: There must be something to do, something I've overlooked.
SPOCK: In chess, when one is outmatched, the game is over. Checkmate.
KIRK: Is that your best recommendation?
SPOCK: I'm s, I regret that I can find no other logical alternative.
MCCOY: Assuming we get out of this, Captain
KIRK: Nobody's given up yet.
MCCOY: Well, then about Bailey. Let me enter it in my medical records
as simple fatigue.
KIRK: That's my decision, Doctor.
MCCOY: And your mistake. You overworked him, pushed him, expected too
much from him.
KIRK: I'm ordering you to drop it. I have no time for you, your
theories, your quaint philosophies.
MCCOY: I intend to challenge your actions in my records. I'll state
that I warned you about Bailey's condition. Now that's no bluff.
KIRK: Any time you can bluff me, Doctor.
BALOK [OC]: Three minutes.
KIRK: All right, Doctor. Let's hope we have time to argue about it. Not
chess, Mister Spock, poker. Do you know the game? Ship to ship.
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.
KIRK: This is the Captain of the Enterprise. Our respect for other
lifeforms requires that we give you this warning. One critical item of
information that has never been incorporated into the memory banks of
any Earth ship. Since the early years of space exploration, Earth
vessels have had incorporated into them a substance known as corbomite.
It is a material and a device which prevents attack on us. If any
destructive energy touches our vessel, a reverse reaction of equal
strength is created, destroying
BALOK [OC]: You now have two minutes.
KIRK: Destroying the attacker! It may interest you to know that since
the initial use of corbomite more than two of our centuries ago, no
attacking vessel has survived the attempt. Death has little meaning to
us. If it has none to you then attack us now. We grow annoyed at your
foolishness.
SPOCK: However, it was well played. I regret not having learned more
about this Balok. In some manner he was reminiscent of my father.
SCOTT: Then may heaven have helped your mother.
SPOCK: Quite the contrary. She considered herself a very fortunate
Earth woman.
KIRK: Doc. Sorry.
MCCOY: For having other things on your mind? My fault. I don't how the
devil you keep from punching me in the face.
SULU: One minute. I knew he would. (Bailey enters) If anyone's
interested, thirty seconds.
BAILEY: Request permission to return to post, sir.
KIRK: Permission granted.
SULU: Eleven, ten seconds, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three,
two, one.
SPOCK: A very interesting game, this poker.
KIRK: It does have advantages over chess. 
MCCOY: Love to teach it to you.
BALOK [OC]: This is the Commander of the Fesarius.
KIRK: Here it comes. Is it raise or call?
BALOK [OC]: The destruction of your vessel has been delayed. We will
relent in your destruction only if we have proof of your corbomite
device.
KIRK: Hold on that. Let him sweat for a change. Ship to ship.
UHURA: Hailing frequencies, sir.
KIRK: Request denied.
SPOCK: I have visual contact, Captain.
BALOK [on viewscreen]: We will soon inform you of our decision
regarding your vessel. And having permitted your primitive efforts to
see my form, I trust it has pleased your curiosity. And now, another
demonstration of our superiority.
MCCOY: I thought the power was off in the galley.
RAND: I used a hand phaser, and zap. Hot coffee.
SULU: Something's going on, Captain. (something leaves the Fesarius) 
KIRK: It's a small ship. 
SPOCK: About two thousand metric tons.
BALOK [OC]: It has been decided that I will conduct you to a planet of
the First Federation which is capable of sustaining your lifeform.
There you will disembark and be interned. Your ship will be destroyed,
of course.
SPOCK: Engine systems coming on, Captain.
BALOK [OC]: Do not be deceived by the size of this pilot vessel. It has
an equal potential to destroy your vessel.
SPOCK: Tractor beam again.
BALOK [OC]: So that you may sustain your gravity and atmosphere, your
systems are now open. Escape is impossible since you are being taken
under our power to your destination. Any move to escape or destroy this
ship will result in the instant destruction of the Enterprise and
everyone aboard.
SULU: We're being towed, sir.
Captain's Log, star date 1514.1. The Enterprise is
in tow. To this point, no resistance has been offered. My plan? A show
of resignation. Balok's tractor beam has to be a heavy drain of power
on his small ship. Question. Will he grow careless?
[Bridge]
BAILEY: Captain, he's pulling out a little ahead of
us.
SPOCK: He's sneaked power down a bit.
SULU: Our speed is down to point six four of light.
KIRK: I want a right angled course. Shear away from him no matter which
way he turns.
BAILEY: Yes, sir.
KIRK: Maximum acceleration when I give the word.
SULU: Yes, sir.
KIRK: Engage.
SULU: It's a strain, Captain. Engines are overloading.
KIRK: More power.
SPOCK: We're superheating. Intermix temperature, seven thousand four
hundred degrees. Seven five, seven six, eight thousand degrees.
(everything is juddering, the little ship is getting brighter and
brighter)
KIRK: Shear away, Mister Bailey.
SPOCK: Two thousand degrees above maximum. Eight four, eight five,
eight six. She'll blow soon!
KIRK: Now, Mister Sulu. Impulse power two.
BAILEY: We're breaking free, sir.
KIRK: All engines stop.
SULU: All engines stopped, sir.
SCOTT: Engines need work badly, Captain. Can you hold it here a few
hours?
SPOCK: That may not be wise. He got a signal through to the mother ship.
KIRK: Then we're not home yet.
UHURA: A signal, Captain. It's very weak. It's Balok. It's a distress
signal to the Fesarius. His engines are out. His life-sustaining system
isn't operating. The message is repeating, sir.
KIRK: Any reply?
UHURA: Negative, sir. The signal is growing weak. Sir, I doubt if the
mother ship could have heard it.
KIRK: Plot a course for it, Mister Bailey.
SPOCK: For it, Captain?
KIRK: Dead ahead. This is the Captain speaking. First Federation vessel
is in distress. We're preparing to board it. There are lives at stake.
By our standards, alien life but lives nevertheless. Captain out.
BAILEY: Course plotted and laid in, sir.
KIRK: Mister Scott, ready the transporter room.
SCOTT: Aye, sir. (leaves)
KIRK: Mister Sulu, bring us to within one hundred metres. Ahead slow.
SULU: Ahead slow, sir.
MCCOY: Jim, don't you think
KIRK: What's the mission of this vessel, Doctor? To seek out and
contact alien life, and an opportunity to demonstrate what our
high-sounding words mean. Any questions? I'll take two men with me.
Doctor McCoy to examine and treat the aliens if necessary, and you,
Mister Bailey.
BAILEY: Sir?
KIRK: The face of the unknown. I think I owe you a look at it.
BAILEY: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: Captain, request permission to
KIRK: Denied. If I'm wrong, if it's a trap, I want you here.
[Transporter room]
KIRK: Transporter ready?
SCOTT: Well, yes, sir, but it's risky. We're locked on what appears to
be a main deck.
KIRK: Air sample?
SCOTT: Breathable. In fact, a slightly higher oxygen content than our
own. Communicator, phaser weapon.
KIRK: Thank you, Scotty. Ready, Doctor?
MCCOY: No, but you won't let that stop you.
SCOTT: Bend low, gentlemen. It reads pretty cramped over there. Ready
to transport.
KIRK: Energise.
[Balok's ship]
KIRK: It's a dummy. A puppet of some kind.
BALOK: I'm Balok. Welcome aboard. (curtain opens to reveal a small
humanoid with big grin)
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. 
BALOK: And McCoy and Bailey. Sit. Be comfortable. Go ahead, be seated.
We must drink. This is tranya. I hope you relish it as much as I.
KIRK: Commander Balok.
BALOK: I know, I know, a thousand questions. But first, the tranya.
Gentlemen. (drinks) Ahh.
KIRK: Commander, that puppet.
BALOK: My alter ego, so to speak. In your culture, he would be Mister
Hyde to my Jekyll. You must admit he's effective. You would never have
been frightened by me. And I thought my distress signal quite clever.
It was a pleasure testing you.
BAILEY: Testing us?
KIRK: I see.
BALOK: I had to discover your real intentions.
KIRK: But you probed our memory banks.
BALOK: Your records could have been a deception on your part.
MCCOY: And your crew?
BALOK: I have no crew, Doctor. I run everything, this entire complex,
from this small ship. But I miss company, conversation. Even an alien
would be welcome. Perhaps one of your men for some period of time. An
exchange of information, cultures.
KIRK: Yes. Both our cultures would benefit. Do you know where we can
find a volunteer, Mister Bailey?
BAILEY: Me, sir. I'd like to volunteer.
BALOK: Ah. You represent Earth's best, then.
BAILEY: No, sir, I'm not. I'll make plenty of mistakes. 
KIRK: But you'd find out more about us that way, and I'd get a better
officer in return.
BALOK: (laughs) I see. We think much alike, Captain, you and I. Now,
before I bring back the Fesarius, let me show you my vessel. It is not
often I have this pleasure. Yes, we're very much alike, Captain. Both
proud of our ships.

Original Airdate: 17 Nov, 1966
  [Starbase
11, outside] 
 PIPER: Welcome to Starbase Eleven, Captain. The
Commodore's waiting to see you. He's curious why you suddenly changed
course and came here.
KIRK: We received a subspace message asking us to divert here
immediately.
PIPER: This base sent no message, Captain.
[Mendez' office]
MENDEZ: Oh, Jim, I just can't understand this.
KIRK: Mister Spock received a starbase transmission, a message from the
former commander of the Enterprise, Fleet Captain Pike, urgently
requesting that we divert here.
MENDEZ: Impossible.
KIRK: If my first officer states he received a transmission from 
MENDEZ: Jim, I'm not doubting anyone's word. I'm simply telling you
it's impossible.
KIRK: Why?
MENDEZ: You don't know? You actually don't know what's happened to
Captain Pike? There's been subspace chatter about it for months.
I'm sorry to have to be the one to show you. He's upstairs in the
medical section.
[Intensive Care Area]
MENDEZ: You ever met Chris Pike?
KIRK: When he was promoted to Fleet Captain.
MENDEZ: About your age. Big, handsome man, vital, active.
KIRK: I took over the Enterprise from him. Spock served with him for
several years.
SPOCK: Eleven years, four months, five days.
MCCOY: What's his problem, Commodore?
MENDEZ: Inspection tour of a cadet vessel. Old Class J starship. One of
the baffle plates ruptured.
MCCOY: The delta rays?
MENDEZ: He went in bringing out all those kids that were still alive.
Just wanted you gentlemen to be prepared.
[Pike's room]
MENDEZ: Captain Pike. (a scarred head and shoulders
sticking out of wheelchair device) Captain, you remember these
gentlemen. They wanted to visit you. Two flashes mean no. I thought you
might make an exception for them. (flash, flash) I'm sorry, gentlemen.
KIRK: Chris, if there's anything I can do for you. (flash, flash)
SPOCK: Captain Pike, may I remain for a moment? (flash, the others
leave) You know why I've come, Captain. It's only six days away at
maximum warp and I have it well-planned. (flash, flash) I have never
disobeyed your orders before, Captain, but this time I must. (flash,
flash)
I know. I know it is treachery and it's mutiny. but I must do this.
(flash, flash) I have no choice. (flash, flash)
[Mendez' office]
KIRK: Once more, Jose. Spock stated he received a
message for us to come here. He entered same in his log. That's all the
proof I require.
MENDEZ: And what do those record tapes show? No message sent from here.
No message received by your vessel.
KIRK: Then I suggest the record tapes have been deliberately changed. A
computer expert can change record tapes, duplicate voices, say
anything, say nothing.
MENDEZ: The fact remains that your first officer's former captain is
hospitalised, horribly injured, at this base, and that same first
officer seems to be the only one who heard that message.
KIRK: If he had wanted to see Captain Pike he could have requested a
leave. I would have granted it.
MENDEZ: Well, that's true of course.
KIRK: Who would want to divert us here? There's no trouble in the space
sector we're patrolling now. No alien problems.
MENDEZ: Computer Centre.
[Starbase Computer Centre]
HUMBOLDT: Chief Humboldt here, sir.
MENDEZ [OC]: Have you rechecked all the record tapes on the date in
question?
HUMBOLDT: Yes, sir.
MENDEZ [OC]: Is there any way at all a message could have been sent
from here without us knowing it?
HUMBOLDT: Negative, Commodore. We've checked and double-checked
everything possible.
MENDEZ [OC]: All right. Start checking the impossible. Mendez out. 
(Spock creeps up behind Humboldt and neck-pinches him, then does
something to the innards of a computer bank) 
[Mendez' office]
MENDEZ: Oh, have I introduced Miss Piper, Jim? This
is Captain Kirk, Miss Piper.
PIPER: I recognized the Captain immediately. A mutual friend described
you, sir. Lieutenant Helen Johansson.
KIRK: Helen described 
PIPER: She merely mentioned she knew you, sir.
MENDEZ: You have something to report, Miss Piper?
PIPER: Oh, yes, sir. I'm afraid our investigation turned up very
little, Commodore. There is, of course, Mister Spock's years of service
with Captain Pike. Indications of his extreme loyalty to this former
commander.
KIRK: Miss Piper, a Vulcan can no sooner be disloyal than he can exist
without breathing. That goes for his present commander as well as his
past.
PIPER: We're forced to consider every possibility, sir. We can be
certain Captain Pike cannot have sent a message. In his condition he's
under observation every minute of every day.
MENDEZ: And totally unable to move, Jim. His wheel chair is constructed
to respond to his brain waves. Oh, he can turn it, move it forwards, or
backwards slightly.
PIPER: With the flashing light, he can say yes or no.
MENDEZ: But that's it, Jim. That's as much as that poor devil can do.
His mind is as active as yours and mine, but it's trapped inside a
useless vegetating body. He's kept alive mechanically, a battery-driven
heart. 
KIRK: There's no way he could even have asked for that message to be
sent?
[Starbase Computer Centre]
VOICE [OC]: (slow) Starbase Operations. (fast)
Starbase Operations. (Spock adjusts it to sound normal) Starbase
Operations. Starbase Operations, Enterprise. Standby to receive new
orders, Enterprise.
[Bridge]
UHURA: Starbase Operation, Mister Hansen. 
VOICE [OC]: Starbase Operations to Enterprise. Standby to receive new
orders. They're to be fed directly into the ship's computers. This is
top secret and scrambled.
HANSEN: Enterprise standing by. Request confirmation.
UHURA: Enterprise to Starbase. Request confirmation.
[Starbase Computer Centre]
CHIEF: Sir, this is a security area. What are you
doing here? 
SPOCK: I have security clearance, Chief.
CHIEF: Who gave you clearance? I haven't been notified. You're
cross-circuiting the. (struggle) Whose tapes are these?
UHURA [OC]: Repeat, Enterprise to Starbase. Orders received. We need
operating confirmation from the ship's Captain. (Spock pinches the
Chief unconscious) 
[Bridge]
UHURA: Come in, Starbase. Come in, Captain Kirk.
[Starbase Computer Centre]
(Spock inserts data chip) 
KIRK [OC]: This is Captain Kirk. You have confirmation, Miss Uhura.
[Bridge]
HANSEN: Hansen here, Captain. 
[Starbase Computer Centre]
HANSEN [OC]: Our destination has been scramble-fed
into ship's computers. Er, how can I handle the helm if I don't know
where we're going?
KIRK [OC]: (another chip) Mister Spock is with me here. He'll answer
all questions. Kirk out.
SPOCK: This is Mister Spock. 
[Bridge]
SPOCK [OC]: The ship's computers will handle the
helm on this voyage, Mister Hansen. Course will be computed and set
automatically. 
[Starbase Computer Centre]
SPOCK: You will not discuss this with ship's crew
or starbase personnel. Do you read?
[Bridge]
HANSEN: Acknowledged, sir.
[Starbase Computer Centre]
SPOCK: Stand by. We'll warp out of orbit in one
hour.
[Mendez' office]
KIRK: (watching Pike on monitor) He keeps blinking
no. No to what?
MCCOY: They've tried questioning him. He's almost agitated himself into
a coma.
KIRK: How long will he live?
MCCOY: As long as any of us. Blast medicine anyway. We've learned to
tie into every human organ in the body except one. The brain. The brain
is what life is all about. Now, that man can think any thought that we
can, and love, hope, dream as much as we can, but he can't reach out,
and no one can reach in.
KIRK: He keeps blinking no.
MCCOY: No to what? They could question him for days, weeks, before they
stumble on the right thing.
KIRK: Bones, could this have anything to do with Spock?
MCCOY: I don't read you at all, Jim.
KIRK: What I mean is either a message was received. It was one of two
things. Either someone sent a message diverting us here, or someone on
board the ship lied about receiving it. Could that someone be Mister
Spock?
MCCOY: Jim, forgetting how well we both know Spock, the simple fact
that he's a Vulcan means he's incapable of telling a lie.
KIRK: He's also half human.
MCCOY: And that half is completely submerged. To be caught acting like
us or even thinking like us would completely embarrass him.
KIRK: Someone's interfering with my command and my ship. I don't know
who it is, but I mean to find out. Even you. If I thought you had the
technical know-how I'd suspect you, but you don't. Spock does.
MCCOY: He would not make a false entry. 
KIRK: There's a false entry in the log right now which doesn't jibe
with the established facts. How do you explain that.
MCCOY: I can't, but to question Spock of all people? Me, yes. I could
run off half-cocked given a good reason. So could you, but not Spock.
It's impossible.
VOICE [OC]: Doctor McCoy, report to Transporter Control. Doctor McCoy
to Transporter Control.
MCCOY: McCoy here.
VOICE [OC]: You're needed aboard the Enterprise, Doctor. Medical
emergency.
MCCOY: Well, what is it? Sickness? Injury? How bad is it?
VOICE [OC]: That's all we have on it, Doctor. Just needed aboard.
MCCOY: Probably somebody discovered a hangnail. I'll beam up and let
you know, Jim.
KIRK: (reading) For eyes of Starfleet Command only.
MENDEZ: Oh, I'm certifying I ordered you to read it. Know anything at
all about this planet?
KIRK: What every ship Captain knows. General Order 7, no vessel under
any condition, emergency or otherwise, is to visit Talos Four. 
MENDEZ: And to do so is the only death penalty left on our books. Only
Fleet Command knows why. Not even this file explains that. (unlocks the
magnetic strip) But it does name the only Earth ship that ever visited
the planet.
KIRK: The Enterprise, commanded by Captain Christopher Pike.
MENDEZ: With a half Vulcan science officer named Spock.
PIPER: Commodore! Captain Pike, he's gone!
MENDEZ: Mendez here. What is it?
VOICE [OC]: Starship Enterprise, Commodore. It's warping out of orbit.
Refuses to acknowledge our signal.
[Bridge]
HANSEN: Out of orbit, Mister Spock. Seems strange
with no navigator on duty.
SPOCK: The Enterprise knows where she's going, Mister Hansen.
UHURA: Someone's trying to hail us, sir.
SPOCK: Maintain radio silence, Lieutenant. This is First Officer Spock.
Per Starfleet orders this date, I have been placed in temporary command
of the Enterprise. While our destination is secret, our mission is
relatively simple. Starbase Command has assigned Captain Kirk medical
rest leave until our return. His instructions are that you will obey my
orders as you would his. First Officer out.
MCCOY: What's going on around here? Who said Jim needed a medical rest
leave? And this call about me being needed aboard the ship. I've
checked everywhere. 
SPOCK: And no one from the ship made such a call.
MCCOY: That's right. 
SPOCK: Doctor, I regret they elected to keep certain things from you.
Will you come with me, please.
[Pike's quarters]
MCCOY: What is this, Spock? Captain, are you all
right? (flash, flash) I see that you're still signaling
SPOCK: Doctor, one moment, please.
KIRK [OC]: Kirk to Doctor McCoy. I'm recording you this message, Bones,
so there will be no misunderstanding. I'm sorry to have to make it an
order. You're not to disturb Captain Pike with any questions. Simply
take good care of him. Follow Spock's instructions to the letter. Kirk
out. (flash, flash) 
[Bridge]
HANSEN: Sir, scanners report an object following
us, about the size of a starbase shuttlecraft. Shall we reverse helm?
SPOCK: Take no action, Mister Hansen.
HANSEN: But at our speed, they'll never catch us. In case they want to
reach us 
SPOCK: You have your orders, Mister Hansen. We'll make no contact.
[Shuttlecraft]
MENDEZ: Starbase Shuttlecraft one to Enterprise.
Come in, please. Enterprise, Commodore Mendez and Captain Kirk. If you
read me, you are ordered to reply. Repeating it on all emergency
frequencies, Jim.
KIRK: Spock is headed for Talos Four, all right.
MENDEZ: Pulling ahead of us fast. Fuel is down to sixty three point
three. If we turn back now, we've just got barely enough to get us back
to the base.
KIRK: Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise,
come in. Enterprise, come in!
[Bridge]
COMPUTER: Library computer.
SPOCK: Lock on to sensors. Measure object now following the Enterprise.
COMPUTER: Computed. Object is a Class F shuttlecraft. Duranium metal
shell, ion engine power
SPOCK: Stop. How long before shuttlecraft's fuel supply forces return
to starbase?
COMPUTER: Computed. Shuttlecraft is already past point of safe return.
[Shuttlecraft]
MENDEZ: We coast.
KIRK: Blast you any way. You had no right to come along.
MENDEZ: RHIP, Captain. Rank hath its privileges.
KIRK: Two hours of oxygen left.
MENDEZ: Wonderful.
KIRK: Part of me is hoping the Enterprise won't come back for us. We
step on that deck, Spock is finished. Court-martialed, disgraced. 
MENDEZ: He's dead if he makes it to Talos Four. Why would he want to
get Pike there? The command reports stated Talos contained absolutely
no practical benefits to mankind.
KIRK: Spock would have some logical reason for going there.
MENDEZ: Maybe. Maybe he's just gone mad.
[Bridge]
MCCOY: I keep wondering who might be after us in a
shuttlecraft and I keep coming up with the same answers, but I can't be
right, can l, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Computer control. Lock on to shuttlecraft following us.
COMPUTER: Locked on. Tractor beam ready.
SPOCK: Go to tape Abel Seven Baker. Execute instructions.
MCCOY: Is it the captain, Mister Spock?
HANSEN: Sir, the engines are reversing. She's brought herself to a dead
stop.
SPOCK: This is the First Officer speaking. Security, send an armed team
to the Bridge. Transporter Room, stand by to beam Captain Kirk aboard.
Effective until then, Lieutenant Hansen is in operational command.
HANSEN: Sir?
SPOCK: First Officer out. Doctor, as senior officer present, I present
myself to you for arrest.
MCCOY: You what?
SPOCK: The charge is mutiny, Doctor. I never received orders to take
command.
SECURITY: Security reporting, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Doctor.
MCCOY: Mister Spock is, er, under arrest. Is confinement to quarters
enough?
SPOCK: Adequate, Doctor. I'll make no trouble.
MCCOY: Well, confine him.
SECURITY: Yes, sir.
[Transporter room]
KIRK [OC]: Store our shuttlecraft on the hangar
deck, Mister Scott. Beam us directly aboard.
SCOTT: All right, Captain. Locked on to you.
HANSEN: Transferring command to you, sir.
KIRK: Accepting command. Where's Mister Spock?
HANSEN: In his quarters, under arrest.
MENDEZ: His quarters, after what he's done, Lieutenant?
UHURA [OC]: Captain from Bridge. The engines are coming on.
KIRK: Reverse power. Hold this position. Tell whoever gave those orders
to report
HANSEN: Sir, there's nobody up there giving orders. Mister Spock has
the computers running the ship.
KIRK: Disengage computer control, Uhura.
UHURA [OC]: We can't disengage, Captain. The helm does not respond.
(Scott leaves, muttering in
Gaelic)
KIRK: Computer control, come in.
COMPUTER: Computer.
KIRK: Disengage from helm.
COMPUTER: Unable to comply.
[Spock's quarters]
KIRK [on monitor]: This is the Captain. On voice
command, you will override all contrary
instructions. Voice command, disengage from helm.
COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Any such attempt will cross-circuit
vessel's life-supporting system. Computer control cannot be disengaged
until vessel reaches planet Talos Four.
Captain's log, stardate 3012.4. Despite our best
efforts to disengage computers, the Enterprise is still locked on a
heading for the mysterious planet Talos Four. Meanwhile, as required by
Starfleet General Orders, a preliminary hearing on Lieutenant Commander
Spock is being convened. And in all the years of my service, this is
the most painful moment I've ever faced.
[Hearing room]
KIRK: This hearing is convened. Mister Spock,
you're aware of your right to counsel of your choice?
SPOCK: Sir, I waive counsel. Further, I waive rights to this hearing
and request immediate court-martial.
KIRK: Request denied.
SPOCK: May I inquire on what grounds, Captain?
KIRK: A mutiny requires a trial board of no less than three command
officers. Since there are only two of that rank available
SPOCK: Sir, I must point out that there are three officers of command
rank available. Yourself, Commodore Mendez, and Captain Christopher
Pike.
KIRK: Denied. Captain Pike is a complete invalid.
SPOCK: I believe you'll find he's still on the active duty list.
MENDEZ: We didn't have the heart to retire him, Jim. He's got you.
Whatever he's up to, he's planned it well.
Captain's log, stardate 3012.6. General
Court-Martial convened. Mister Spock has again waived counsel and has
entered a plea of guilty.
MENDEZ: Mister Spock, are you aware in pleading
guilty that a further charge involving the death penalty must be held
against you should this vessel enter the Talos star group?
SPOCK: I am.
MENDEZ: Why? What does it accomplish to go there or to take Captain
Pike there? I want to know why.
SPOCK: Are your comments a part of the record, sir?
MENDEZ: Yes, it's on the record.
SPOCK: Thank you. Request monitor screen be engaged.
MENDEZ: For what purpose?
SPOCK: To comply with the request you just made, sir, that I explain
the importance of going to Talos Four.
KIRK: By asking why, you've opened the door to any evidence he may wish
to present. Apparently what he had in mind.
MENDEZ: Present your evidence. Screen on.
SPOCK: This is thirteen years ago. The Enterprise and its commander,
Captain Christopher Pike.
SPOCK [on screen]: Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this
way.
KIRK: Screen off. Chris, was that really you on the screen? (flash)
That's impossible. Mister Spock, no vessel makes record tapes in that
detail, that perfect. What were we watching?
SPOCK: I cannot tell you at this time, sir.
MENDEZ: Captain Pike, were any record tapes of this nature made during
your voyage? (flash, flash) The court is not obliged to view evidence
without knowing its source.
SPOCK: Unless the court asks a prisoner why, Commodore. You did ask
that question.
MENDEZ: You mean I was maneuvered into asking. Your evidence is out of
order.
KIRK: I am forced to contest that, Commodore. I want to see more.
MENDEZ: You have that right, Captain, but just because the prisoner is
your First Officer and your personal friend
KIRK: That has nothing to do with it.
MENDEZ: Very well, continue.
KIRK: Screen on, Mister Scott.
NUMBER ONE [on screen]: No. It's something else. There's still
something out there.
SPOCK: As I stated, gentlemen, this was thirteen years ago. We were on
routine patrol when the ship's sensors detected something ahead. At
first we were not certain what it was.
TYLER [on screen]: It's coming at the speed of light. Collision course.
[Bridge]
TYLER: The meteorite beam has not deflected it,
Captain.
NUMBER ONE: Evasive manoeuvres, sir?
PIKE: Steady as we go. 
COMM OFFICER: It's a radio wave, sir. We're passing through an
old-style distress signal.
PIKE: They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this
way.
COMM OFFICER: A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir. That's
it. No other message.
TYLER: I have a fix. It comes from the Talos star group.
NUMBER ONE: We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.
SPOCK: Their call letters check with a survey expedition. S.S. Columbia
disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
TYLER: It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to
here.
SPOCK: Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar
system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class
M, oxygen atmosphere.
NUMBER ONE: Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years.
PIKE: If they survived the crash.
SPOCK: We aren't going to go, to be certain?
PIKE: Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega
Colony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the
helm. Maintain present course.
NUMBER ONE: Yes, sir.
[Pike's quarters]
BOYCE [OC]: Boyce here.
PIKE: Drop by my cabin, Doctor. (Boyce enters with bag) What's that? I
didn't say there's anything wrong with me.
BOYCE: I understand we picked up a distress signal.
PIKE: That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it
seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to
log the ship's doctor's opinion, too.
BOYCE: Oh, I concur with yours, definitely.
PIKE: Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the
Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also.
What the devil are you putting in there, ice?
BOYCE: Who wants a warm martini?
PIKE: What makes you think I need one?
BOYCE: Sometimes a man will tell his bartender things he'll never tell
his doctor. What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel seven?
PIKE: Shouldn't it be? My only yeoman and two others dead, seven
injured.
BOYCE: Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?
PIKE: Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the
armour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted
fortress and attacked by one of their warriors.
BOYCE: Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You
treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now
you're tired and you
PIKE: You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for
two hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too
risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who
doesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil.
BOYCE: To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?
PIKE: To the point of considering resigning.
BOYCE: And do what?
PIKE: Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles
of park land around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we
used to take some food and ride out all day.
BOYCE: Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day.
PIKE: I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on
Regulus or on the Orion colony.
BOYCE: You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?
PIKE: The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole
galaxy of things to choose from.
BOYCE: Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets
it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to
wither away.
PIKE: Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender.
BOYCE: Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers.
The living and the dying.
SPOCK [on monitor]: Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up
message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos.
[Bridge]
OFFICER: (reads) Eleven survivors from crash.
Gravity and oxygen within limits. Food and water obtainable, but
unless. The message faded at that point, sir.
PIKE: Address intercraft.
TYLER: System open.
PIKE: This is the captain. Our destination is the Talos star group.
[Hearing room]
PIKE [on screen]: Our time warp, factor seven.
TYLER [on screen]: Course computed and on the screen.
NUMBER ONE [on screen]: All decks have acknowledged, sir.
PIKE [on screen]: Engage.
MENDEZ: Screen off. Mister Spock, I'm truly amazed at your technical
prowess in somehow manufacturing all this. I congratulate you on your
imagination. But this is a court of space law, not a theatre.
SPOCK: Captain, please tell the court this is not imagination, nor some
clever photographic record. Are we seeing the actual events of thirteen
years ago? (flash) Yes, gentlemen. On that screen as it happened, the
incredible experience of Captain Christopher Pike on Talos Four. If,
after witnessing this, the court wishes to turn this vessel back, I
will release this ship to manual control.
MENDEZ: You're in no position to bargain. This is ridiculous. This man
mutinied, stole your ship, abducted Captain Pike. Well, for me this has
gone far enough.
KIRK: We still haven't heard the full story. I vote to continue.
MENDEZ: And I vote we do not. Deadlock, and since I'm 
KIRK: Not a deadlock. There's still one member of the trial board to be
heard from.
MENDEZ: Very well. Captain Pike, it's up to you. Do we continue under
these conditions? (flash)
KIRK: Yes.
Captain's log supplemental. Mister Spock, on trial for mutiny, has
forced the court to accept unusual evidence. On our monitor screen, the
voyage of Captain Pike and the Enterprise to the one forbidden world in
all the galaxy.
MENDEZ: Screen on.
[Bridge]
TYLER: We've settled into orbit, sir.
GEOLOGIST: Geological lab report complete, Captain.
SPOCK: Preliminary lab survey ready, sir.
PIKE: Spectography?
GEOLOGIST: Our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, sir, heavy
with inert elements but well within safety limits.
PIKE: Gravity?
GEOLOGIST: Zero point nine of Earth.
TYLER: Captain? Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface. As I read
it, they polarise out as rounded metal bits. Could be parts of a
spaceship hull.
PIKE: Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it?
SPOCK: Yes, sir.
TYLER: Yes, sir. 
PIKE: Sorry, Number One. With little information on this planet, we'll
have to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us.
NUMBER ONE: Of course, sir.
[Transporter room]
PIKE: There's no indication of problems down there,
but let's not take chances.
PITCAIRN: Yes, sir. There's a canyon to the left. We can set you there
completely unobserved.
PIKE: Right.
[Planet surface]
(the group explores until they find a rough
settlement) 
CREWMAN: Sir.
OLD MAN: They're men. They're humans.
PIKE: Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise.
HASKINS: Doctor Theodore Haskins, American Continent lnstitute.
SURVIVOR: Is Earth all right?
PIKE: The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon.
TYLER: And you won't believe how fast you can get back. Well the time
barrier's been broken. Our new ships can
HASKINS: This is Vina. Her parents are dead. She was born almost as we
crashed.
(The reunion is being watched on another screen, by people with big
bald heads) 
PIKE: (as the survivors pack up the settlement) Enterprise.
NUMBER ONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.
PIKE: We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to
you very shortly.
NUMBER ONE [OC]: Quarters are being prepared, sir. Have I permission to
send out scouting and scientific parties now?
PIKE: Yes, affirmative on the
VINA: You appear to be healthy and intelligent, Captain. A prime
specimen.
NUMBER ONE [OC]: I didn't get that last message, Captain.
PIKE: Er, affirmative on request. Landing party out.
HASKINS: You must forgive her choice of words, Captain. She's lived her
whole life with a collection of aging scientists.
BOYCE: If they can, er, spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical
report.
VINA: I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.
BOYCE: Their health is excellent, almost too good.
HASKINS: There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt
if Earth is ready to learn the secret. Let the girl show you. We'll
accept your judgment.
(Pike follows Vina up a slope to a ledge by a rock face) 
VINA: You're tired, but don't worry. You'll feel much better soon.
Don't you see it? Here and here.
PIKE: I, I don't understand.
VINA: You will. You're a perfect choice. 
(she vanishes, and so do all the survivors and their encampment. A door
opens in the rock face, Pike is knocked out and taken inside. At the
settlement -) 
TYLER: Captain! (everyone rushes over in time to see the door closing
in the rock. They fire their phasers at it to no avail. 
[Hearing room]
SPOCK [on screen]: Spock here.
NUMBER ONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.
SPOCK [on screen]: There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This
is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?
KIRK: What is it?
UHURA [OC]: It's for Commodore Mendez.
KIRK: Plead signal for you, sir. Go ahead, Uhura.
UHURA [OC]: Commodore Mendez, urgent. Subspace monitors show Enterprise
receiving transmissions from planet Talos Four in violation of
Starfleet General Orders.
KIRK: Receiving transmissions from Talos Four? Then the images we've
been seeing are
SPOCK: Are coming from Talos Four, sir.
UHURA [OC]: Captain Kirk is here by relieved. You are ordered to assume
command of the Enterprise. Disable vessel if necessary to prevent
further contact. Message signed ComSol, Starfleet Command.
MENDEZ: Mister Spock, you're aware of the orders regarding any contact
with Talos Four. You have deliberately invited the death penalty.
You've not only finished yourself, Spock, but you've finished your
Captain as well.
SPOCK: The Commodore must be aware that Captain Kirk knew nothing of
this.
MENDEZ: And you're aware a Captain is responsible for everything that
occurs on his ship. I order you to return this vessel back to manual
control.
SPOCK: Sir, I respectfully decline.
MENDEZ: Very well. You've earned the consequences. This court is in
recess.
(Mendez and yeoman leave, Scott and McCoy wheel Pike out after him)
KIRK: Do you know what you're doing? Have you lost your mind?
SPOCK: Captain, Jim, please don't stop me. Don't let him stop me. It's
your career and Captain Pike's life. You must see the rest of the
transmission.
KIRK: Lock him up.
To be concluded next week...

The
Menagerie, part 2
Stardate:3012.4 
Original Airdate: 24 Nov, 1966
 
Personal log, stardate 3013.1. I find it hard to believe the events of
the past twenty four hours or the plea of Mister Spock
standing general court-martial.
[Recap of part one] 
MENDEZ: How do you plead to the charge of
unlawfully taking command?
SPOCK: Guilty.
MENDEZ: Of sabotaging the computers of this vessel and locking it on a
course for planet Talos Four?
SPOCK: Guilty.
MENDEZ: And of forcibly attempting to transport Captain Pike to that
planet?
SPOCK: Guilty.
KIRK [OC]: Why? Why does Spock want to take to that forbidden world his
former
captain. Mutilated by a recent space disaster,
now a shell of a man, unable to speak or move? The only answer Spock
would give was on the hearing-room screen.
How Spock could do this he refused to explain, but there before our
eyes, actual images from thirteen years ago of Captain Pike as he was
when he commanded this vessel, of Spock in those days, and of how the
Enterprise had become the first and only starship to visit Talos Four.
They had received a distress signal from that planet and discovered
there, still alive after many years, the survivors of a missing vessel,
only to find it was all an illusion. No survivors, no encampment, it
was all a trap set by a race of beings who could make a man believe he
was seeing anything they wished him to see, and Captain Pike was gone,
a prisoner for some unknown purpose.
KIRK: And the images we've been seeing are
SPOCK: Are coming from Talos Four, sir.
MENDEZ: Mister Spock, you're aware of the orders regarding any contact
with Talos Four. You have deliberately invited the death penalty.
KIRK: Do you know what you're doing? Have you lost your mind?
SPOCK: Captain, Jim, please. Don't stop me. Don't let him stop me. It's
your career and Captain Pike's life. You must see the rest of the
transmission.
[Hearing room]
KIRK [OC]: The court-martial of Mister Spock has
been convened in closed session. Despite all we can do, images continue
to be transmitted to us from Talos Four.
MENDEZ: Starfleet has ordered no contact with Talos Four. They made no
exceptions.
SPOCK: You have no choice, sir. I'm sorry. The Keeper has taken over
control of our screen. Do you understand, sir? (flash) As you saw
before, Captain Pike had been knocked unconscious and captured by the
Talosians.
[Pike's cage]
(Pike discovers there is a transparent wall
blocking his escape, and tests it's strength. A group of aliens arrive)
PIKE: Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the
space vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this
galaxy. Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me?
(the aliens communicate with their minds, not voices)
TALOSIAN: It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen
is shockingly limited.
MAGISTRATE: This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so
easily with a simulated message. As you can read in its thoughts, it is
only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a
simple illusion we placed in their minds.
PIKE: You're not speaking, yet I hear you.
MAGISTRATE: You will note the confusion as it reads our thought
transmissions.
PIKE: All right, then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read
yours. Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an
unfriendly act
MAGISTRATE: You now see the primitive fear/threat reaction. The
specimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel,
and so on. Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess,
the creature will throw himself against the transparency.
PIKE: If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these
walls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it.
MAGISTRATE: Despite its frustration, the creature appears more
adaptable than our specimens from other planets. We can soon begin the
experiment. 
[Briefing room]
SPOCK: The inhabitants of this planet must live
deep underground, probably manufacture food and other needs down there.
Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more
vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.
NUMBER ONE: So we just thought we saw survivors there.
SPOCK: Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's
inhabitants.
BOYCE: It was a perfect illusion. They had us seeing just what we
wanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery,
everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp,
the tattered clothing, everything. Now let's be sure we understand the
danger of this. The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds, they
can create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and
experiences, even out of a person's own desires. Illusions just as real
and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore.
TYLER: It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help.
SPOCK: If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their
mental power's so great they could reach out and swat this ship as
though it were a fly.
TYLER: Now that entry may have stood up against hand lasers but we can
transmit the ship's power against it, enough to blast half a continent.
NUMBER ONE: Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power. We'll
try blasting through that metal.
[Talosian monitoring room]
TALOSIAN: Thousands of us are already probing the
creature's thoughts, Magistrate. We find excellent memory capacity.
MAGISTRATE: I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it
fought to protect its life. We will begin with this, giving the
specimen something more interesting to protect.
[Rigel 7]
VINA: Come on, we must hide ourselves. Come, come,
hurry. It's deserted. There'll be weapons and perhaps food.
PIKE: This is Rigel Seven.
VINA: Please, we must hide ourselves.
PIKE: I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo. I must still be
there.
VINA: Come on.
PIKE: They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere
I've been.
VINA: The Kaylar!
PIKE: It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago, except for you.
[Hearing room]
SPOCK: A brilliant deduction by Captain Pike,
gentlemen. Yes, he was still inside his cell, but knowing that couldn't
help him.
KIRK: The Talosians controlled his brain.
SPOCK: And could make him live any place, any time, any situation they
wished. He would see, taste, suffer with the same reality as you
gentlemen sitting there.
PIKE [on screen]: Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one
the survivors call Vina. Or rather the image of Vina. But why you
again? Why didn't they create a different girl?
[Rigel 7]
VINA: Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.
PIKE: But it's only a dream.
VINA: You have to kill him as you did here before.
PIKE: You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an
animal performing for its supper.
VINA: It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it. That's what
matters. You'll feel every moment of what happens to you.
(so Pike fights the Kaylar, first with mace and shield, then whatever
he can grab. He is pushed off a ledge, and as it jumps off after him,
he impales it on a barbed spearhead)
[Pike's cell]
VINA: It's over. (she hugs her hero, then sees the
Talosians)
[Hearing room]
MENDEZ: What is it? Why have they stopped the
images?
SPOCK: Because they know that Captain Pike is fatigued. We can
reconvene later.
KIRK: Then they care about the Captain.
SPOCK: They want him back alive, sir.
MENDEZ: I demand to know why.
SPOCK: If you'll be patient, the answers to your questions
MENDEZ: You're forgetting you're on trial, Spock. You will answer all
questions put to you.
SPOCK: My answer to your question would be quite unbelievable, sir. I
regret we'll have to wait and see it there.
Personal log, stardate 3013.2. Reconvening
court-martial of Mister Spock and the strangest trial evidence ever
heard aboard a starship. From the mysterious planet now only one hour
ahead of us, the story of Captain Pike's imprisonment there.
[Hearing room]
PIKE [on screen]: Why are you here?
VINA [on screen]: To please you.
PIKE [on screen]: Are you real?
VINA [on screen]: As real as you wish.
[Pike's cell]
PIKE: No, no. No, that's not an answer. I've never
met you before, never even imagined you.
VINA: Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.
PIKE: What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear?
VINA: I can wear whatever you wish, be anything you wish.
PIKE: So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how
I react, is that it?
VINA: Don't you have a, a dream, something you've always wanted very
badly?
PIKE: Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too?
VINA: You can have whatever dream you want. I can become anything, any
woman you, you've ever imagined. You can have anything you want in the
whole universe. Let me please you.
PIKE: Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there
any way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts
against me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way?
VINA: You're a fool.
PIKE: Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this
conversation, is there?
[Planet surface]
NUMBER ONE: All circuits engaged, Mister Spock.
SPOCK [OC]: Standing by, Number One.
NUMBER ONE: Take cover.
SPOCK [OC]: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
(the phaser cannon blasts at the rock face)
NUMBER ONE: Increase to full power! Can you give us any more?
SPOCK [OC]: Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease
power.
NUMBER ONE: Disengage. The top of that knoll should have been sheared
off the first second.
BOYCE: Maybe it was. It's what I tried to explain in the briefing room.
Their power of illusion is so great, we can't be sure of anything we
do, anything we see.
[Pike's cell]
VINA: Perhaps if you asked me some questions I
could answer.
PIKE: How far can they control my mind?
VINA: If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let
me live it with you?
PIKE: Perhaps.
VINA: They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do.
PIKE: But they try to trick me with their illusions.
VINA: And, er, they can punish you when you're not co-operative. You'll
find out about that. 
PIKE: Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go
underground?
VINA: War, thousands of centuries ago.
PIKE: That's why it's so barren up there?
VINA; The planet's only now becoming able to support life again.
PIKE: So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and
they concentrated on developing their mental power.
VINA: But they found it's a trap, like a narcotic, because when dreams
become more important than reality, you give up travel, building,
creating. You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by
your ancestors. You just sit, living and reliving other lives left
behind in the thought record.
PIKE: Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.
VINA: You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion
for you, they watch you react, feel your emotions. They have a whole
collection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from
all over this part of the galaxy.
PIKE: Which means they had to have more than one of each animal.
VINA: Please.
PIKE: They'll need a pair of humans too. Where do they get intend to
get the Earth woman?
VINA: You said that if I answered questions
PIKE: But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist. You said
you weren't real, remember?
VINA: I'm a woman as real and as human as you are. We are like Adam and
Eve. If we. No, please, no! Don't punish me! I'll die! (disappears)
[Hearing room]
MENDEZ: An Earth woman? Then you were captured as
breeding stock. (flash) 
KIRK: Why? Just to maintain a supply of zoo specimens?
SPOCK: Much more, Captain.
[Pike's cell]
(as Pike searches the walls for a door, a hatch
opens and a glass is placed on the floor)
KEEPER: The vial contains a nourishing protein complex.
PIKE: Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?
KEEPER: If the form and the colour is not appealing, it can appear as
any food you wish to visualise.
PIKE: And if I prefer
KEEPER: To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of
punishment.
(Pike is surrounded by fire and brimstone, screaming in pain)
KEEPER: From a fable you once heard in childhood. You will now consume
the nourishment.
PIKE: Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you
can't, can you? You do have limitations, don't you?
KEEPER: If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there are
things even more unpleasant.
(he drinks the nourishment then launches himself at the glass wall. The
Keeper steps back in surprise)
PIKE: That's very interesting.
KEEPER: Now to the female.
PIKE: You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then?
KEEPER: As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our planet,
but with only a single survivor.
PIKE: No, let's stay on the first subject. All I wanted for that moment
was to get my hands around your neck.
KEEPER: We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species
interesting.
PIKE: Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through?
KEEPER: It became necessary to attract a mate.
PIKE: All right, all right. Let's talk about the girl. You seem to be
going out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel
protective.
KEEPER; This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species.
PIKE: Seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and
like her.
KEEPER: We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life.
PIKE: Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her? So
I'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship? That would be necessary
only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human
community.
KEEPER: With the female now properly conditioned.
PIKE: You mean properly punished! I'm the one who's not cooperating!
Why don't you punish me?
KEEPER: First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy.
Excellent.
[Woodland glade]
VINA: You want some coffee, dear? I left the
thermos hooked to my saddle.
PIKE: Tango! You old devil, you. Uh, I'm sorry I don't have any sugar.
Well, they think of everything, don't they? (feeds lumps to the horse) 
VINA: Is it good to be home?
PIKE: They read our minds very well. Home, anything else I want if I
co-operate, is that it?
VINA: My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it? You're home. You
can even stay if you want.
PIKE: But we're not here, neither of us. We're in a menagerie, a cage!
VINA: No.
PIKE; I can't help either one of us if you won't give me a chance. Now,
you told me once they used illusions as a narcotic. They couldn't
repair the machines left by their ancestors. Is that why they want us,
to build a colony of slaves?
VINA: Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us?
PIKE: Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our
keeper couldn't read my thoughts. Do emotions like hate, keeping hate
in your mind, does that block off our mind from them?
VINA: Yes. They can't read through primitive emotions, but you can't
keep it up for long enough. I've tried. They keep at you and at you
year after year, tricking and punishing, and they won. They own me. I
know you must hate me for that.
PIKE: Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like.
VINA: But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my
feelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man. That's why they
picked you. I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the
same way.
PIKE: If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you. I
was from the very first moment I saw you in the survivor's camp. You
were like a wild little animal. 
VINA; I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for you. You've
been home, and fighting as on Rigel. That's not new to you, either. A
person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do. Yes, a ship's
captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and
proper. You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that.
[Open air party]
(a band plays, and a green woman dances sensuously)
TRADER: Nice place you have here, Mister Pike.
PIKE: Vina?
[Hearing room]
KIRK: That's Vina again, as the green Orion slave
girl? (flash)
MENDEZ: They're like animals, vicious, seductive. They say no human
male can resist them.
KIRK [OC]: Strange evidence from the past, how the Talosians, planning
to breed a society of human slaves, tempted Captain Pike with the Earth
woman they held in captivity. And as she appeared to him in many forms,
each more exciting than the last, Pike was beginning to weaken.
[Open air party]
OFFICER: Suppose you had all of space to choose
from and this was only one small sample. 
TRADER: Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul?
(Pike gets up and leaves. Vina follows him into the rock room)
[Transporter room]
NUMBER ONE: Now, you all know the situation. We're
hoping to transport down inside the Talosian community.
SPOCK: If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could
find oneself materialised inside solid rock.
NUMBER ONE: Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out.
(Pitcairn energises but only the two women dematerialise) 
SPOCK: The women!
[Pike's cage]
NUMBER ONE: Captain! Captain.
VINA: No! Let me finish!
NUMBER ONE: But we were a party of six.
COLT: We were the only ones transported.
VINA: It's not fair. You don't need them.
PIKE: (grabbing the phase pistols) They don't work.
NUMBER ONE: They were fully charged when we left. It's dead.
(communicator) I can't make a signal. What is it?
PIKE: Don't say anything. I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating
their huge, misshapen heads to pulp, thoughts so primitive they black
out everything else. I'm filling my mind with hate.
VINA: How long can you block your thoughts? A few minutes, an hour? How
can that help?
COLT: Leave him alone.
VINA: He doesn't need you. He's already picked me.
COLT: Picked her? For what? I don't understand.
VINA: Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring.
COLT: Offspring, as in children?
NUMBER ONE: Offspring as in, he's Adam. Is that it?
VINA: You're no better choice. They'd have more luck crossing him with
a computer.
NUMBER ONE: Well, shall we do some time computation? There was a Vina
listed on that expedition as an adult crewman. Now, adding eighteen
years to your age then.
(The Keeper approaches the cage)
VINA: It's not fair. I did what you asked.
KEEPER: Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a selection.
PIKE: I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you. Is your blood
red like ours? I'm going to find out.
KEEPER: Each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour. The
female you call Number One has the superior mind and would produce
highly intelligent children.
PIKE: All I want to do is get my hands on you. Can you read these
thoughts, images of hate, killing?
KEEPER: The other new arrival has considered you unreachable but now is
realising this has changed. The factors in her favour are youth and
strength, plus unusually strong female drives. 
PIKE: You'll find my thoughts more interesting, thoughts so primitive
you can't understand. Emotions so (stricken by pain)
KEEPER: Wrong thinking is punishable. Right thinking will be as quickly
rewarded. You will find it an effective combination. (leaves)
NUMBER ONE: Captain.
PIKE: No. No, don't help me. I have to concentrate. They can't read
through hate.
(the group are apparently dozing when the Keeper opens the hatch to get
the laser pistols Pike dropped there. He grabs him and pulls him into
the cage, and starts to throttle him)
PIKE: Hold still, or I'll break your neck.
VINA: Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil.
PIKE: I've had some samples of how good they are.
(the Talosian appears to be a vicious monster)
PIKE: You stop this illusion, or I'll twist your head off. All right,
now you try one more illusion, you try anything at all, and I'll break
your neck.
KEEPER: Your ship. Release me, or we'll destroy it.
VINA: He's not bluffing, Captain. With illusion they can make your crew
work the wrong controls or push any button it takes to destroy your
ship.
PIKE: I'm going to gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason
at all. (hands him over to Number One and picks up the laser pistols,
firing them at the glass wall) On the other hand, I've got a reason.
I'm willing to bet you've created an illusion this laser is empty. I
think it just blasted a hole in that window and you're keep us from
seeing it. You want me to test my theory out on your head?
COLT: Captain. (there is a hole in the glass, and they all leave
through it)
[Hearing room]
MENDEZ: It seems the Talosians have deserted you.
SPOCK: Gentlemen, a moment, please.
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock?
MENDEZ: (to Pike) May I have your verdict?
SPOCK: Signal you want them to wait. Captain, please. It's your life
now, at least a chance for life.
KIRK: You keep talking about life, Mister Spock. A chance for life.
How? As a prisoner, caged, a zoo specimen, living the illusions that
amuse his keepers?
SPOCK: No, Captain. there's more to it. Watch. (the screen remains
blank)
MENDEZ: Guilty, yes or no, Captain? (flash) Yes. I must also vote
guilty as charged. And you, Captain?
KIRK: Guilty as charged.
[Bridge]
HANSEN: Bridge to Commander.
[Hearing room]
MENDEZ: Mendez here.
HANSEN [on monitor]: Sir, we're entering orbit Talos Four.
SPOCK: Talos controls the vessel now, sir, as they did thirteen years
ago. You've asked me why. You'll see the answer now.
[Planet surface]
PIKE: Make contact, Number One.
NUMBER ONE: They kept us from seeing this, too. We cut through and
never knew it. Captain.
KEEPER: As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing.
PIKE: I want to contact our ship.
KEEPER: You are now on the surface where we wished you to be. With the
female of your choice, you will now begin carefully guided lives.
PIKE: And start by burying you?
KEEPER: That is your choice. To help you reclaim the planet's surface,
our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life.
PIKE: Look, I'll make a deal with you. You and your life for the lives
of these two Earth women. You give me proof that our ship is all right,
send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina.
NUMBER ONE: (setting laser pistol to overload) It's wrong to create a
whole race of humans to live as slaves.
KEEPER: Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves?
VINA: What is that?
PIKE: The weapon is building up an overload, a force chamber explosion.
You still have time to get underground. Well, go on! (pushes Vina away)
Just to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her.
VINA: If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go,
either. I suppose if they have one human being, they might try again.
(more Talosians arrive) 
PIKE: Wait.
TALOSIAN: Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much
time. Are you prepared to assimilate it?
KEEPER: We had not believed this possible. The customs and history of
your race show a unique hatred of captivity. Even when it's pleasant
and benevolent, you prefer death. This makes you too violent and
dangerous a species for our needs.
VINA: He means that they can't use you. You're free to go back to the
ship.
PIKE: And that's it. No apologies. You captured one of us, threatened
all of us.
TALOSIAN: Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to
eventual death. Is this not sufficient?
KEEPER: No other specimen has shown your adaptability. You were our
last hope.
PIKE: But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual cooperation.
KEEPER: Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy itself,
too.
NUMBER ONE: Captain, we have transporter control now.
PIKE: Let's get back to the ship.
VINA: I can't. I can't go with you.
[Transporter room]
PITCAIRN: Sir, it just came on. We can't shut the
power off.
SPOCK: Mister Spock here.
TYLER [OC]: All power has come on, Mister Spock. The helm is answering
to control.
(first Colt, then Number One are beamed aboard)
??: The captain.
[Planet surface]
(Vina is changed into a scarred, misshapen older
woman)
VINA: You see why I can't go with you.
KEEPER: This is the female's true appearance.
VINA: They found me in the wreckage, dying, a lump of flesh. They
rebuilt me. Everything works, but they had never seen a human. They had
no guide for putting me back together.
KEEPER: It was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an
honest one.
PIKE: You'll give her back her illusion of beauty? 
KEEPER: And more.
[Transporter room]
PITCAIRN: Mister Spock, the system is coming on
again.
[Hearing room]
COLT [on screen]: What's happened to Vina? 
NUMBER ONE [on screen]: Isn't she coming with us?
PIKE [on screen]: No. No, and I agreed with her reasons.
(scene moves to the Bridge, but we're watching the disabled Pike)
SPOCK [OC]: All decks prepare for hyperdrive.
NUMBER ONE [OC]: All decks are ready, sir.
PIKE [on screen]: Engage.
KIRK: Commodore, don't you think that (Mendez disappears)
KEEPER [on screen]: What you now seem to hear, Captain Kirk, are my
thought transmissions. The Commodore was never aboard your vessel. His
presence there and in the shuttlecraft was an illusion. Mister Spock
had related to us your strength of will. It was thought the fiction of
a court-martial would divert you from too soon regaining control of
your vessel. Captain Pike is welcome to spend the rest of his life with
us, unfettered by his physical body. The decision is yours and his.
KIRK: Mister Spock, even if regulations are explicit, you could have
come to me and explained.
SPOCK: Ask you to face the death penalty, too? One of us was enough,
Captain.
KIRK: Yes.
UHURA [OC]: Message from Starbase Eleven, sir. Received images from
Talos Four. In view of historic importance of Captain Pike in space
exploration, General Order Seven prohibiting contact Talos Four is
suspended this occasion. No action contemplated against Spock. Proceed
as you think best. Signed, Mendez, J.I., Commodore, Starbase Eleven. 
KIRK: Chris, do you want to go there? (flash) Mister Spock, would you
care to take Captain Pike to the transporter room, see him off?
SPOCK: Thank you, sir, for both of us. (flash)
KIRK: Er, Mister Spock, when you're finished, please come back and see
me. I want to talk to you. This regret table tendency you've been
showing lately towards flagrant emotionalism
SPOCK: I see no reason to insult me, sir. I believe I've been
completely logical about the whole affair.
KEEPER [OC] Captain Kirk.
(screen shows the healthy young Vina and healthy young Pike hand in
hand)
KEEPER [on screen]: Captain Pike has an illusion, and you have reality.
May you find your way as pleasant.

The
Conscience of the King
Stardate: 2817.6 
Original Airdate: 8 Dec, 1966
  [Theatre]
 (On stage, a velvet-clad arm raises a bloody
knife, then plunges it again into his sleeping victim. The audience are
rapt.) 
KIRK: Interesting. An Arcturian Macbeth. 
LEIGHTON: (a man with an eyepatch) Watch him. Watch Macbeth. 
LENORE: (as Lady M) Is he dead? Speak. Is King Duncan dead? 
KARIDIAN: Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my
hands. 
LEIGHTON: That voice. He's back. That man on the stage. I'm certain of
it. That's Kodos the Executioner. 
KARIDIAN: Pluck out mine eyes! 
Captain's log, star date 2817.6. Starship
Enterprise diverted from scheduled course. Purpose, to confirm discover
by Doctor Thomas Leighton of an extraordinary new synthetic food which
would totally end the threat of famine on Cygnia Minor, a nearby Earth
colony. 
[Leighton's home]
KIRK: You mean to tell me you've called me three
light years off my course just to accuse an actor of being Kodos? 
LEIGHTON: He is Kodos. I'm sure of it. 
KIRK: You said you discovered a new food concentrate. What am I
supposed to put in my log, that you lied? That you diverted a starship
with false information? You're not only in trouble, you've put me in
trouble, too. 
LEIGHTON: I did it to trap Kodos! 
KIRK: Kodos is dead. 
LEIGHTON: Is he? Is anyone sure? A body burned beyond recognition? 
KIRK: Tom, the authorities closed the book on that case years ago. 
LEIGHTON: Then let's reopen it. Jim, four thousand people were
butchered. 
KIRK: Martha, you tell him. 
MARTHA: I can't tell him anything, Jim. He's been like this since the
company of actors arrived. 
KIRK: Kodos is dead. I'm satisfied of that. 
LEIGHTON: Well, I'm not. I remember him. That voice. The bloody thing
he did. 
(He turns his head to reveal it's not just an eyepatch, but a covering
over half his face) 
LEIGHTON: Jim, Jim, I need your help. There were only eight or nine of
us who actually saw Kodos. I was one, you were another. If he's to be
exposed, 
KIRK: He's dead. 
LEIGHTON: Then it will be a ghost Martha and I receive in our home
tonight. I invited the entire company to a cocktail party. I have to be
sure. 
KIRK: And I have to get back to my ship and figure out how I'm going to
enter all this in my log. Tom. Martha. 
[Briefing room]
COMPUTER: Library computer. 
KIRK: History files. Subject, former Governor Kodos of Tarsus Four,
also known as Kodos the Executioner. After that, background on actor
Anton Karidian. 
COMPUTER: Working. Kodos the Executioner, summary. Governor of Tarsus
Four twenty Earth years ago. Invoked martial law. Slaughtered fifty
percent of population Earth colony, that planet. Burned body found when
Earth forces arrived. No positive identification. Case closed. Detailed
information follows. On stardate 2794.7, 
KIRK: Stop. Information on Anton Karidian. 
COMPUTER: Director and star of travelling company of actors sponsored
by galactic cultural exchange project, touring official installations
last nine years. Has daughter, Lenore, nineteen years old, 
KIRK: Stop. Give comparative identification between actor Karidian and
Governor Kodos. 
COMPUTER: No identification records available on actor Anton Karidian. 
KIRK: Give information on actor Karidian prior to Kodos' death. 
COMPUTER: No information available, Anton Karidian, prior to twenty
years ago 
KIRK: Photograph Kodos. (an image of a red-haired man with a beard
comes on the monitor) Photograph Karidian. (the grey-haired man with a
small moustache) Now photograph both. 
(Door opens) 
KIRK: Mister Spock. You know Doctor Leighton, don't you? Would you say
he's given to fantasy? 
SPOCK: A good empirical research scientist. Steady, reputable,
occasionally brilliant. 
KIRK: With a very long memory. 
SPOCK: I have no information on that, Captain. We are ready to leave
orbit. 
KIRK: We'll delay departure for a time. I'm beaming back down to the
planet. 
[Leighton's home]
(The cocktail party is in full swing in the main
room, and Martha is bringing another tray of drinks for her guests.)
KIRK: Where's Tom? 
MARTHA: He went to town. He called. He's on his way back. 
(The lovely young blonde Lenore Karidian enters, and Kirk beams) 
KIRK: The others are on the patio. 
LENORE: I take it you're the welcoming committee. (referring to his
glass) Is that for me? 
KIRK: Why not? I saw your performance today. May I extend my
appreciation? 
LENORE: My father will be delighted, Mister. Mister? 
KIRK: Captain James Kirk, Starship Enterprise. 
LENORE: We are honoured. 
KIRK: I had hoped to meet your father, here, tonight, personally. 
LENORE: I'm sorry, Captain Kirk. He has a rigid rule about that. He
never sees anyone personally, and he never attends parties. 
KIRK: An actor turning away his admirers? Very unusual. 
LENORE: Karidian is a most unusual man. You saw Macbeth. That was my
father. 
KIRK: Then I'll talk to Lady Macbeth. 
(They sit) 
LENORE: So. Captain of the Enterprise. Interesting. 
KIRK: So, Lady Macbeth. Interesting. What's your next move? 
LENORE: We play two performances at Benecia, if the AstraI Queen can
get us there. 
KIRK: She's a good ship. (takes a glass from a passing tray) Thank you.
You were very impressive as Lady Macbeth. 
LENORE: Thank you. And as Lenore Karidian? 
KIRK: Very impressive. Lenore. I'd like to see you again. 
LENORE: You mean professionally? 
KIRK: Not necessarily. 
LENORE: I think I'd like that. Unfortunately, we must keep a schedule. 
KIRK: You don't have a schedule now, do you? 
LENORE: You mean leave? But I've only just arrived. 
KIRK; So have I. 
LENORE: And you hate to overstay a welcome. 
KIRK: Exactly. 
LENORE: Why not? 
KIRK: Good. I'll make our apologies to our hostess. I'll meet you
outside. 
[Countryside]
(Meandering between rocks and scrubby trees, arm in
arm) 
KIRK; Tired of walking? 
LENORE: No. Just thinking. 
KIRK: About what? 
LENORE: At the party, you were such a brash young man. 
KIRK; And now? 
LENORE: Now somehow different. Not a ship's Captain with all those
people to be strong and confident in front of. You know, you're really
very dear, aren't you? In some ways, very lonely. 
(But just as their lips are about to meet, Kirk spots a body among the
rocks and goes to investigate) 
KIRK: It's Tom Leighton. He's dead. 
[Leighton's home]
(Tom's body is laid out on the couch, and Martha
covers it) 
MARTHA: At least he has peace now. He never really had that before. Oh,
why was Tom killed if what he suspected wasn't true? 
KIRK: I don't know. I'll try and find out. 
MARTHA: Oh, Jim. How I'll miss him. (bursts into tears and leaves) 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. 
UHURA [OC]: Bridge here, Captain. 
KIRK: Put me through to Captain Jon Daily of the AstraI Queen on orbit
station, and put it on scramble. 
UHURA [OC]: Captain Daily's on, sir. 
KIRK; Jon? Jim Kirk. 
DAILY [OC]: Hi, Jim. 
KIRK: Can you do me a favour? 
DAILY [OC]: I owe you a dozen. Just ask. 
KIRK: Don't make your pick-up here. 
DAILY [OC]: You mean strand all those actors? 
KIRK: I'll pick them up. And if there's any trouble, it'll be my
responsibility. 
DAILY [OC]: Will do. Anything else? 
KIRK: Just keep this between the two of us and accept my thanks. Over
and out. Kirk to Enterprise. 
UHURA [OC]: Bridge here, Captain. 
KIRK: Transporter room, ready to beam up. 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Ready to resume course, Captain. 
KIRK: I think we're due for a pick-up. 
SPOCK: What kind? Personnel? Cargo? 
UHURA: Captain? A Miss Karidian has been transported aboard ship. She
requests permission to see you. 
KIRK: Tell her to come up to the Bridge, Lieutenant. 
[Transporter room]
UHURA [OC]: Escort Miss Karidian to the Bridge. 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: How did you know this lady was coming
aboard? 
KIRK: I'm the Captain. 
LENORE: Captain Kirk, I didn't think we'd be meeting again so soon. 
KIRK: You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you I arranged it. 
LENORE: No, but it's a delightful thought. Captain, I'm afraid we need
your help. We've been stranded. It seems that our transportation has
cancelled out on us. 
KIRK: Can't you make other arrangements? 
LENORE: Yes, but not in time. You see, our schedule is like a chain.
One break and it all collapses. 
KIRK: It'd be a shame if that happened. 
LENORE: If ever we needed a Good Samaritan. 
KIRK: Well. 
LENORE: I appeal to you. 
(Spock's eyebrow hits the ceiling) 
KIRK: The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers. 
LENORE: I'll make a bargain with you, Captain. 
KIRK: What have you got to trade? 
LENORE: Special performance for the crew in exchange for a lift. 
KIRK: You make it sound very interesting. The crew has been on patrol
for a long time. They could use a break in the monotony. 
LENORE: Then you'll do it? 
KIRK: You've got me backed into a corner. The men would never forgive
me if I deprived them of your performance, and your presence. 
LENORE: Thank you, Captain. I'm eternally grateful. I'll get the
company ready. This means so much to them. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, prepare to leave orbit as soon as the Karidian
company is aboard the ship. 
(Lenore and her escort enter the turbolift) 
SPOCK: May I inquire as to our course, Captain? 
KIRK: Benecia Colony. 
SPOCK: Benecia Colony is eight light years off our course. 
KIRK: If my memory needs refreshing, Mister Spock, I'll ask you for it.
In the meantime, follow my orders. 
Captain's log, stardate 2818.9. There are many
questions in my mind, too many, perhaps, about the actor Karidian and
his daughter.
For personal reasons, I'm almost afraid to learn the answers. 
[Bridge]
KIRK: Mister Spock, ETA the Benecia Colony. 
SPOCK: We'll arrive stardate 2825.3, Captain, approximately fifteen
hundred Benecia time. 
(Kirk goes over to Spock's station and throws a few switches) 
COMPUTER: Library computer. 
KIRK: Data on question submitted to personnel files. 
COMPUTER: Data being received. Kodos file of all survivors. There are
nine actual eye witnesses who can identify Kodos. 
KIRK: Stop. Give list. 
COMPUTER: Kirk, J., presently Enterprise Captain, Leighton, T.,
Moulton, E., Riley, K., Eames, D., 
KIRK: Stop. Is that star service Lieutenant Kevin Riley? 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. Riley, Kevin. Presently assigned U.S.S.
Enterprise communications section. 
KIRK: Stop. Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
KIRK: Lieutenant Kevin Riley in communications, I wish to have him
transferred down to the engineering decks. 
SPOCK: He came up from engineering, Captain. 
KIRK: I'm sending him back. 
SPOCK: Any explanation? He's a fine young officer. He's bound to
consider this transfer a disciplinary action. 
KIRK: I don't wish to discuss it, Mister Spock. Please follow my
orders. 
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: Mister Spock, the man on top walks a lonely
street. The chain of command is often a noose. 
SPOCK: Spare me your philosophical metaphors, Doctor. The Captain is
acting strangely. I'm asking if you've noticed. 
MCCOY: Negative. Did you know this is the first time in a week I've had
time for a drop of the true? Would you care for a drink, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol. 
MCCOY: Now I know why they were conquered. What are you so worried
about, anyway? I find Jim generally knows what he's doing. 
KIRK: It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard. 
MCCOY: Illogical? Did you get a look at that Juliet? That's a pretty
exciting creature. Of course your, personal chemistry would prevent you
from seeing that. Did it ever occur to you that he simply might like
the girl? 
SPOCK: It occurred. I dismissed it. 
MCCOY: You would. 
SPOCK: Did you know that he suddenly transferred Lieutenant Riley to
engineering? 
MCCOY: Lots of things go on around here that I don't know, Mister
Spock. Now, he's the Captain. He can transfer whoever he pleases. You
can look that up
in a hundred volumes of space regulations somewhere. All right? Come
on, have a drink. 
SPOCK: No, thank you. 
MCCOY: You're welcome. But I will. And please, Mister Spock, if you
won't join me, don't disapprove of me. At least not until you've tried
it, huh? 
[Observation deck]
(Lenore is getting a personal tour of the ship) 
KIRK: This is the observation deck. That's the flight deck down there
with the shuttle craft. 
LENORE: Interesting. 
KIRK: Isn't it? 
LENORE: Tell me, Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: Anything. 
LENORE: Did you order the soft lights especially for the occasion? 
KIRK: If I had ordered soft lights, I'd also have arranged for music
and flowers. Unfortunately, it isn't so. On the Enterprise, we try to
duplicate earth conditions of night and day as closely as possible. 
LENORE: Star light, star bright. I wish I may, I wish I might. Do you
remember that, Captain? 
KIRK: It's very old. 
LENORE: Almost as old as the stars themselves. And this ship. All this
power, surging and throbbing, yet under control. Are you like that,
Captain? All this power at your command, yet the decisions that you
have to make 
KIRK: Come from a very human source. 
LENORE: Are you, Captain? Human? 
KIRK: You can count on it. 
LENORE: Tell me about the women in your world, Captain. 
KIRK: I'd rather talk about you. You must have wanted to perform since
you first saw your father act. When was that? 
LENORE: In the beginning. 
KIRK: Tell me about it. 
LENORE: That's not fair. You haven't answered my question about the
women. 
KIRK: What would you like to know? 
LENORE: Has the machine changed them? Made them just people instead of
women? 
KIRK: Worlds may change, galaxies disintegrate, but a woman always
remains a woman. 
LENORE: All this and power too. The Caesar of the stars and the
Cleopatra to worship him. 
(Finally, a passionate embrace)
[Bridge]
(Spock is on duty, and thinking) 
COMPUTER: Library computer. 
SPOCK: Full personal dossiers on the following names. Doctor Thomas
Leighton, Anton Karidian, Lieutenant Kevin Riley, and Captain James T.
Kirk. 
COMPUTER: Accomplished. Standing by. 
SPOCK: Correlate. Check their past histories. Report any item, any past
episode or experience they all have in common. 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. 
[Corridor]
MCCOY: I appreciate whatever concern you may have
for the ship's company, Mister Spock, 
SPOCK: I will continue, Doctor. According to our library banks, it
started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was
attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed. There were over
eight thousand colonists and virtually no food. And that was when
Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law. 
MCCOY: I've heard of it. 
SPOCK: You may not have heard it all. Kodos began to separate the
colonists. Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left. The
remainder would be immediately put to death. Apparently he had his own
theories of eugenics. 
MCCOY: Unfortunately, he wasn't the first. 
SPOCK: Perhaps not. But he was certainly among the most ruthless, to
decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not, using his own
personal standards, and then to implement his decision without mercy.
Children watching their parents die. Whole families destroyed. Over
four thousand people. They died quickly, without pain, but they died.
Relief arrived, but too late to prevent the executions. And Kodos?
There never was a positive identification of his body. 
MCCOY: What has Karidian to do with it? 
SPOCK: His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared. 
MCCOY: You think Jim suspects he's Kodos? 
SPOCK: He'd better. There were nine eye witnesses who survived the
massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes. Jim Kirk was
one of them.
With the exception of Riley and Captain Kirk, every other eye witness
is dead. And my library computer shows that wherever they were, on
Earth, on a colony, or aboard ship, the Karidian Company of Players was
somewhere near when they died. 
MCCOY: It's unbelievable. 
[Engineering]
(There's just one officer on duty, and he hasn't
touched the meal lying on a plate nearby) 
RILEY: Hey. Rec room. Somebody. 
[Rec room]
RILEY [OC]: Talk to me. 
MATSON: Larry Matson here. Is that you, Riley? 
[Engineering]
MATSON [OC]: What's up? 
RILEY: Not me. I am down. In the engineering room. 
MATSON [OC]: You've been a bad boy. 
RILEY: Maybe so. Whatever I've done, they're sure keeping it a secret
from me. 
[Rec room]
RILEY [OC]: Hey. Is that Uhura playing? Let me talk
to her. 
MATSON: I think his heart is sore. 
UHURA: What can I do for you, Riley? 
[Engineering]
RILEY: A song. Make it a love song. Just something
to reassure me I'm not the only living thing
left in the universe, huh? 
[Rec room]
UHURA: Well, you're not, and I'll prove it to you. 
(sings) The skies are green and glowing 
[Engineering]
UHURA [OC]: Where my heart is 
Where my heart is 
Where the scented lunar flower is growing 
Somewhere beyond the stars 
Beyond Antares. 
(As Riley listens, we see a shadow moving)
[Rec room]
UHURA: I'll be back, though it takes forever 
Forever is just a day 
Forever is just another journey 
{Engineering]
UHURA [OC]: Tomorrow a stop along the way 
(Something gets squirted into Riley's milk) 
UHURA [OC]: Then let the years go fading 
[Rec room]
UHURA: Where my heart is 
[Engineering]
(Riley reaches for his tray) 
UHURA [OC]: Where my heart is 
Where my love eternal is waiting' 
Somewhere beyond the stars 
Beyond Antares. 
(He drinks)
[Rec room]
UHURA: How'd you like that, Riley? 
[Engineering]
(But Riley is sweating and choking) 
RILEY: Help me, please. 
(He collapses)
[Sickbay]
SPOCK: You've got to pull him through. 
MCCOY: I'm not sure I can. 
SPOCK: If he dies, the only one who'll be able to identify Kodos is the
Captain. And he'll be the next target. 
Captain's log, stardate 2819.1. Ship's officer
Riley's condition worsening. Doctor McCoy making lab analysis to
determine cause and antidote. Entire crew deeply concerned. 
[McCoy's office]
MCCOY: As of this date, lab report indicates
presence of appreciable amount of tetralubisol, a highly volatile
lubricant in use aboard ship. 
SPOCK: Someone tried to poison him. 
MCCOY: Tetralubisol us a milky substance. Someone could have gotten
careless, made a mistake. 
SPOCK: I don't believe that and neither do you. I want the Captain to
see that report. 
MCCOY: When I've finished logging it. 
SPOCK: Now. 
[Captain's quarters]
KIRK: Come. 
MCCOY: My report on Lieutenant Riley. 
KIRK: Will he make it? 
MCCOY: He's got a good chance. 
SPOCK: Can we predict the same for you, Captain? 
KIRK: All right, Mister Spock. Let's have it. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you. 
KIRK: All right. 
SPOCK: Someone tried to kill him. 
MCCOY: Could have been an accident. 
SPOCK: You should be told the difference between empiricism and
stubbornness, Doctor. I checked with the library computer, just as you
did. I got the same information. 
KIRK: Aren't you getting a little out of line, Mister Spock? My
personal business, 
SPOCK: Is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth
operation of this ship. 
KIRK: You think that happened? 
SPOCK: It could happen. 
KIRK: I don't like anyone meddling in my private affairs. Not even my
second in command. 
MCCOY: Jim, Spock's simply trying, 
KIRK: I know what he's doing, and I don't like it. 
MCCOY: It's his job, and you know it. 
KIRK: And you also know that nothing is proven. 
SPOCK: Even in this corner of the galaxy, Captain, two plus two equals
four. Almost certainly an attempt will be made to kill you. Why do you
invite death? 
KIRK: I'm not. I'm interested in justice. 
MCCOY: Are you? Are you sure it's not vengeance? 
KIRK: No, I'm not sure. I wish I was. I've done things I've never done
before. I've placed my command in jeopardy. From here on I've got to
determine whether or not Karidian is Kodos. 
SPOCK: He is. 
KIRK: You sound certain. I wish I could be. Before I accuse a man of
that, I've got to be. I saw him once, twenty years ago. Men change.
Memory changes. Look at him now, he's an actor. He can change his
appearance. No. Logic is not enough. I've got to feel my way, make
absolutely sure. 
MCCOY: What if you decide he is Kodos? What then? Do you play God,
carry his head through the corridors in triumph? That won't bring back
the dead, Jim. 
KIRK: No, but they may rest easier. 
(A scene break, during which McCoy apparently leaves) 
SPOCK: Logic, Captain. Doctor Leighton was murdered while the Karidian
Company was on Planet Q. Now an attempt has been made against Riley
while the company is on board the Enterprise. 
KIRK: Doc isn't sure it was a murder attempt. Besides, I have an idea
may prove 
SPOCK: Shh. Listen. Do you hear it? That low hum. 
KIRK: A phaser. 
SPOCK: On overload. (starts searching) 
KIRK: This is the Captain. There's a phaser on overload in my quarters.
If it blows, it'll take out the entire deck. Evacuate all personnel in
this quadrant. Double Red Alert. (now starts searching himself) You get
out of here. 
SPOCK: You can't stay. 
KIRK: Go on. Block off this section. Hurry. I'll find it. 
[Corridor]
SPOCK: Evacuate this section. Seal it off. Clear
section C4 and C5. 
(In Kirk's quarters the noise gets louder, and finally he sees the
phaser silhouetted against the Red Alert light high in a bulkhead. He
gets it, dashes into the corridor and drops it into a convenient
pressure waste disposal unit directly opposite. Spock returns in time
for the bang that throws them against the opposite wall)
[Karidian's quarters]
KIRK: (barging in without knocking) We're overdue
for our talk, aren't we? 
KARIDIAN: I hoped you would have respected my privacy, Captain. 
KIRK: A moment ago, we narrowly averted an explosion which would have
destroyed several decks of this ship. Before that, someone tried to
poison one of my crewmen. 
KARIDIAN: I am sorry to hear that. 
KIRK: I'm sure you are. Are you Kodos? I asked you a question. 
KARIDIAN: Do you believe that I am? 
KIRK: I do. 
KARIDIAN: Then I am Kodos, if it pleases you to believe so. I am an
actor. I play many parts. 
KIRK: You're an actor now. What were you twenty years ago? 
KARIDIAN: Younger, Captain. Much younger. 
KIRK: So was I. But I remember. Let's see if you do. Read this into
that communicator on the wall. It will be recorded and compared to a
piece of Kodos' voice film we have in our files. The test is virtually
infallible. It will tell us whether you're Karidian, or Kodos the
Executioner. (switches on comm.) Ready for voice test. Disguising your
voice will make no difference. 
KARIDIAN: (reading) The revolution is successful, but survival depends
on drastic measures. Your continued existence represents a threat to
the well-being of society. (stops looking at the paper) Your lives
means slow death to the more valued members of the colony. Therefore I
have no alternative but to sentence you to death. Your execution is so
ordered. Signed, Kodos, governor of Tarsus Four. 
KIRK: I remember the words. I wrote them down. You said them like you
knew them. You hardly glanced at the paper. 
KARIDIAN: I learn my parts very quickly. 
KIRK: Are you sure? Are you sure you didn't act this role out in front
of a captive audience whom you blasted out of existence without mercy? 
KARIDIAN: I find your use of the word mercy strangely inappropriate,
Captain. Here you stand, the perfect symbol of our technical society.
Mechanised, electronicised, and not very human. You've done away with
humanity, the striving of man to achieve greatness through his own
resources. 
KIRK: We've armed man with tools. The striving for greatness continues.
But Kodos 
KARIDIAN: Kodos, whoever he was 
KIRK: Or is. 
KARIDIAN: Or is. Kodos made a decision of life and death. Some had to
die that others might live. You're a man of decision, Captain. You
ought to understand that. 
KIRK: All I understand is that four thousand people were needlessly
butchered. 
KARIDIAN: In order to save four thousand others. And if the supply
ships hadn't come earlier than expected, this Kodos of yours might have
gone down in history as a great hero. 
KIRK: But he didn't. And history has made its judgment. 
KARIDIAN: If you're so sure that I'm Kodos, why not kill me now? Let
bloody vengeance take its final course! And see what difference it
makes to this universe of yours. 
KIRK: Those beautiful words, well acted, change nothing. 
KARIDIAN: I suppose not. They're merely tools, like this ship of yours.
KIRK: There are no previous records to Anton Karidian prior to twenty
years ago. 
KARIDIAN: Blood thins. The body fails. One is finally grateful for a
failing memory. I no longer treasure life, not even my own. I am tired!
And the past is a blank. Did you get everything you, wanted, Captain
Kirk? 
KIRK: If I had gotten everything I wanted, you might not walk out of
this room alive. 
LENORE: Captain Kirk. 
(She enters from the next room) 
LENORE: (to Karidian) You'd better rest now. There's a stain of cruelty
on your shining armour, Captain. You could have spared him, and me. You
talked of using tools. I was a tool, wasn't l? A tool to use against my
father. 
KIRK: In the beginning perhaps. But later, I wanted it to be more than
that. 
LENORE: Later. Everything's always later. Later. Latest. Too late. Too
late, Captain. You are like your ship, powerful, and not human. There
is no mercy in you. 
KIRK: If he is Kodos, then I've shown him more mercy than he deserves.
And if he isn't, then we'll let you off at Benecia, and no harm done.
LENORE: Captain Kirk. Who are you to say what harm was done? 
KIRK: Who do I have to be? 
[Sickbay]
(Kevin is pacing up and down in the background,
overhearing what is being dictated) 
MCCOY: Medical log. Lieutenant Riley's sufficiently recovered to be
discharged, but the Captain's ordered him restricted to Sickbay to
prevent contact with the passenger who calls himself Karidian and who's
suspected of being Kodos the Executioner and of murdering the
Lieutenant's family. 
Captain's log, stardate 2819.8. Suspect under
surveillance. Strategic areas under double guard. Performance of the
Karidian Players
taking place as scheduled. 
[Ship's Theatre]
  
LENORE: (on stage) Tonight, the Karidian Players
present Hamlet, another in a series of living plays presented in space,
dedicated to the tradition of classic theatre. Hamlet is a violent play
about violent times when life was cheap and ambition was God. 
[Kirk's quarters]
(Two pieces of paper are lined up on his desk) 
SPOCK: I believe we have a match, Captain. 
KIRK: But not an exact match, Mister Spock. We're dealing with a man's
life. No machine can make that decision. 
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: In the long history of medicine, no doctor
has ever caught the first few minutes of a play. Riley, don't forget to
(but he's not there) 
MCCOY: Riley? Captain Kirk, McCoy here. 
KIRK [OC]: Yes, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Riley's gone. I was recording my log about Karidian and Kodos.
If he overheard 
[Kirk's quarters]
KIRK: You've made your point, Doctor. 
SECURITY [OC]: Captain? Security, H deck, The weapons locker has been
broken into. One phaser is missing. 
KIRK: This is the Captain. Security two alert. Find and restrain
Lieutenant Kevin Riley. He's armed and possibly headed towards the
ship's theatre. 
[Ship's Theatre]
(The Ghost summons Hamlet) 
HAMLET: Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I'll go no further. 
KARIDIAN Mark me. 
HAMLET: I will. 
(Kirk comes creeping around backstage) 
KARIDIAN: My hour is almost come, when I to sulphurous and tormenting
fires must render up myself. 
HAMLET: Speak. I am bound to hear. 
KARIDIAN: So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear. I am thy
father's spirit, doomed for a certain term to walk the night, 
(Kirk spots Kevin with the phaser) 
KIRK: Riley, get back to the Sickbay. 
RILEY: He murdered my father, and my mother. 
KIRK: You could be wrong. Don't throw away your life on a mistake. 
RILEY: I'm not wrong. 
KARIDIAN: But that I am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house, 
RILEY: I know that voice, that face, I know it. I saw it. He murdered
them. 
KARIDIAN: Thy soul, freeze thy young blood. 
KIRK: It's an order. Give me the weapon. 
(Takes it from Riley) 
KIRK: Now get back to Sickbay. Go on. 
(Riley leaves, and there is polite applause at the end of the scene on
stage. Karidian comes backstage.) 
LENORE: It's going beautifully. What is it? What's wrong? 
KARIDIAN: There was a voice out of the past haunting me, torturing me.
There was another part I once played long ago. I never told you about
it. Now that same curtain rises again. The time has come. 
LENORE: No, Father. The time will never come. Tonight, after my
performance, the last two who can harm you will be gone. 
KARIDIAN: What are you saying? 
LENORE: There were nine. Now there are only two, and they will be gone
as soon as I. Don't look at me like that. 
KARIDIAN: What have you done? 
LENORE: What had to be done. They had to be silenced. 
KARIDIAN: All of them? All seven? More blood on my hands? 
LENORE: No Father, not anymore. I'm strong, Father. It's nothing. 
STAGEHAND [OC]: Second act, three minutes. 
LENORE: We'll be ready. Don't you see? All the ghosts are dead. I've
buried them. There's no more blood on your hands. 
KARIDIAN: Oh, my child, my child. You've left me nothing! You were the
one thing in my life untouched by what I'd done. 
LENORE: But you're safe now, Father. I've saved you. Now, no one can
touch you. Not even Captain Kirk. See Caesar come? He's awed by your
greatness, your shining brightness. Bright as a blade before it is
stained with blood. 
KIRK: Bright as a blade. Come with me, both of you. 
LENORE: Of course. After the play. 
KIRK: The play is over. It's been over for twenty years. 
KARIDIAN: I was a soldier in a cause. There were things to be done,
terrible things. 
LENORE: Stop it, Father! You have nothing to justify. 
KARIDIAN: Murder, flight, suicide, madness. I never wanted the blood on
my hands ever to stain you. 
LENORE: I did it for you. I've saved you. 
KIRK: By killing seven innocent men. 
LENORE: They weren't innocent! They were dangerous! I would have killed
a world to save him! 
STAGEHAND [OC]: Curtain going up, one minute.
(Kirk takes Karidian's arm) 
LENORE: The play, Captain. He must go on. This is the great Karidian.
KIRK: Guard.
LENORE: You cannot deny him his last performance! 
(She grabs the security guard's phaser and runs out onto the stage) 
KARIDIAN: Lenore, don't!
KIRK: You'll never get off the ship.
LENORE: It will become a floating tomb, drifting through space with the
soul of the great Karidian giving performances at every star he
touches. (Kirk moves towards her) I know how to use this, Captain.
KARIDIAN: No.
LENORE: Caesar, beware the ides of March.
KARIDIAN: No, child! Don't! 
(As she squeezes the trigger, her father steps in front of Kirk, and
takes the shot himself. Lenore screams at what she has done. and
Kirk takes the phaser from her as she kneels over Karidian's body) 
LENORE: Father. Father! O, proud, death! What feast is toward in thine
eternal cell, that thou, such a prince at a shot so bloodily hast
struck? The curtain, the curtain rises. It rises. There's no time to
sleep. The play. The play. The play's the thing, wherein we'll catch
the conscience of the king. 
[Bridge]
MCCOY: Medical report. (hands it over) She'll
receive the best of care, Jim. She remembers nothing. She even thinks
her father's still alive giving performances before cheering crowds.
You really cared for her, didn't you? 
SPOCK: Ready to leave Benecia orbit, Captain. 
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Leslie. All channels cleared, Uhura?
UHURA: All channels clear, sir.
KIRK: Whenever you're ready, Mister Leslie.
LESLIE: Leaving orbit, sir.
MCCOY: You're not going to answer my question, are you?
KIRK: Ahead warp factor one, Mister Leslie.
MCCOY: That's an answer.

Original Airdate: 15 Dec, 1966
  [Ship's
Chapel] 
 SCOTT: The ceremony will be carried on all viewing
screens, sir. 
KIRK: Good. 
MCCOY: There was a call for you from the Bridge. 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
SPOCK [OC]: Still no answer from Earth Outpost number two, Captain, and
now number three's gone silent. 
KIRK: Maintain course to outpost four. Keep me informed. Kirk out. 
(At the door, a young lady in gold uniform and a pretty head-dress
takes Scott's arm and is escorted into the room, to the strains of
'Here Comes The Bride'. Kirk goes to the rostrum.) 
KIRK: Since the days of the first wooden vessels, all shipmasters have
had one happy privilege. That of uniting two people in the bonds of
matrimony. We are gathered here today with you, Angela Martine, and
you, Robert Tomlinson, in the sight of your fellows, in accordance with
our laws and our many beliefs so that you may pledge your 
SULU [OC]: Alert! Alert! All decks alert! Alert! Alert! Captain to the
Bridge. All decks alert. 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
SPOCK [OC]: Earth Outpost four reports they're under attack. A space
vessel, identity unknown. 
KIRK: Full ahead. All decks, condition red. 
[Corridor]
SULU [OC]: All decks, condition red. All decks,
condition red. 
Captain's Log, stardate 1709.2. Patrolling outposts
guarding the neutral zone between planets Romulus and Remus and the
rest of the galaxy, received emergency call from outpost 4. The U.S.S.
Enterprise is moving to investigate and assist. 
[Bridge]UHURA: Outpost 4 reported under attack, sir. Then
message terminates. 
SPOCK: Verified, Captain. 
SULU: Our speed is now maximum, sir. 
STILES: Position, eight minutes from Outpost four at this velocity,
sir. 
KIRK: Scotty. 
SCOTT: I've talked to my engine room, sir. We'll get more speed out of
her. 
KIRK: Did Outpost 4 give anything at all on the attacking vessel,
Lieutenant? 
UHURA: No identification, sir. 
STILES: There can't be much doubt who's attacking, sir. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, put this star sector on our screen. Now show our
position. Signal this to all decks, Lieutenant. 
UHURA: All decks standing by, sir. 
[Corridor]
KIRK [OC]: This is the Captain speaking. In our
next action, we can risk neither miscalculation nor error 
[Bridge]
KIRK: By any man aboard. Listen carefully. Science
Officer. 
SPOCK: Referring to the map on your screens, you will note beyond the
moving position of our vessel, a line of Earth outpost stations.
Constructed on asteroids, they monitor the Neutral Zone established by
treaty after the Earth-Romulan conflict a century ago. 
[Sickbay]
SPOCK [OC]: As you may recall from your histories,
this conflict was fought, 
[Engineering]
SPOCK [OC]: By our standards today, with primitive
atomic weapons and in primitive space vessels 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Which allowed no quarter, no captives. Nor
was there even ship-to-ship visual communication. Therefore, no human,
Romulan, or ally has ever seen the other. Earth believes the Romulans
to be warlike, cruel, treacherous, and only the Romulans know what they
think of Earth. The treaty, set by sub-space radio, established this
Neutral Zone, entry into which by either side, would constitute an act
of war. The treaty has been unbroken since that time. Captain. 
KIRK: What you do not know and must be told is that my command orders
on this subject are precise and inviolable. No act, no provocation 
[Engineering]
KIRK [OC]: Will be considered sufficient reason to
violate the zone. We may defend ourselves, 
[Sickbay]
KIRK [OC]: But if necessary to avoid interspace
war, 
[Bridge]
KIRK: Both these outposts and this vessel will be
considered expendable. Captain out. 
STILES: We know Outpost four has been attacked, sir, so if we intercept
Romulans now 
KIRK: After a whole century, what will a Romulan ship look like, Mister
Stiles? I doubt they'll radio and identify themselves. 
STILES: You'll know, sir. They're painted like a giant bird-of-prey. 
KIRK: I had no idea that history was your specialty. 
STILES: Family history. There was a Captain Stiles was in the space
service then. Two Commanders and several junior officers. All lost in
that war, sir. 
KIRK: Their war, Mister Stiles. Not yours. Don't forget it. 
STILES: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: Outpost two coming into sensor range, Captain. 
KIRK: Outpost 2 was the first to go silent, Lieutenant? 
UHURA: Yes, Captain, then Outpost three an hour later. 
SPOCK: Sweeping the area of Outpost two. Sensor reading indefinite.
Double-checking Outpost three. I read dust and debris. Both Earth
outposts gone,
and the asteroids they were constructed on, pulverised. 
KIRK: Open a channel to our nearest command base. Quarter hour reports
on our position and status. 
UHURA: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: Call battle stations, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Battle stations. All hands to battle stations. Battle stations.
Battle stations. All decks acknowledge. All decks acknowledge, sir. All
stations show green. 
KIRK: Energise main phasers, Mister Styles. All weapons to full power. 
STILES: All weapons to full power. Phaser control room. 
[Phaser Control]
STILES [OC]: Energise. Acknowledge. 
ANGELA: (the bride) Phaser control acknowledging. All weapons
energising to full. 
ROBERT: (the groom) Happy wedding day, almost. 
ANGELA: You won't get off my hook this easily. I'm going to marry you,
Mister, battle or phaser weapons notwithstanding. 
ROBERT: Well, meanwhile, temporarily at least, I am still your superior
officer. So get with it, Mister. 
TEC 1: Port weapons show ready. 
TEC 2: Starboard and midship weapons show ready. 
ANGELA: Acknowledge. All weapons batteries ready. 
[Bridge]
STILES: Outpost four now five minutes away, sir. 
SPOCK: And showing on my sensors, Captain. At least it's still there. 
UHURA: Sir, regaining contact with Outpost four. Switching to speakers.
HANSEN [OC]: Outpost four. Do you read me, Enterprise? This is
Commander Hansen. 
KIRK: Kirk here. We're minutes away, Hansen. What's your status? 
HANSEN [OC]: Outposts two, three, and eight are gone. Unknown weapon.
Completely destroyed, even though we were alerted. Had our deflector
shield on maximum. Hit by enormous power. First attack blew our
deflector shield. If they hit us again with our deflector shield gone.
Do you read me, Enterprise? 
KIRK: Confirm what hit you, Hansen. What vessel? Identity? 
HANSEN [OC]: Space vessel, only glimpse of. 
KIRK: Can you locate the intruder for us? 
HANSEN [OC]: Negative. It seems to have disappeared somehow. I have you
on my screen now. Switching to visual. 
KIRK: Tie us in. 
UHURA: Tied in, sir. 
(The viewscreen shows a man in a wrecked room, surrounded by fires) 
HANSEN [on viewscreen]: Enterprise, can you see it? My command post
here. We're a mile deep on an asteroid. Almost solid iron. And even
through our deflectors, it did this. Can you see? 
KIRK: Affirmative. You're visual, Hansen. What do you have on the
intruder? 
HANSEN [on viewscreen]: No identification. No answer to our challenge.
Only a glimpse of it. Then they fired something at us, some form of
high-energy plasma.
Fantastic power. And then the whole vessel disappeared. But it's out
there somewhere. Our sensors show that much. Enterprise, something
coming on our viewing screen, coming at us fast. 
KIRK: Lock us onto your screen. 
HANSEN [on viewscreen]: Switching. Can you see it, Enterprise? Can you
see it? It's becoming visible in the centre of my screen. 
(A ship appears from nowhere on the screen) 
KIRK: Do you have phaser capacity? We're still out of range. 
HANSEN: Negative. Phasers gone. Weapons crew dead. 
KIRK: Make a challenge. Warn that ship off. 
UHURA: Trying to, sir. They don't acknowledge. 
(The alien ship fires a big red plasma ball, and the viewscreen
switches to Hansen as the outpost is hit, then just bright light. Back
to the attacking ship, which then vanishes.) 
SPOCK: Outpost four disintegrated, Captain. 
KIRK: Position of the intruder, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Disappeared. Interesting how they became visible for just a
moment. 
KIRK: When they opened fire. Perhaps necessary when they use their
weapon. SPOCK: I have a blip on the motion sensor. Could be the
intruder. 
KIRK: Go to full magnification. 
SULU: Screen is on full mag, sir. 
KIRK: I don't see anything. I can't understand it. 
SPOCK: Invisibility is theoretically possible, Captain, with selective
bending of light. But the power cost is enormous. 
They may have solved that problem. 
UHURA: Continuing to challenge, sir. Still no response. 
KIRK: Discontinue. Contact remaining outposts. Have them signal us any
sightings or sensor readings in their area. 
UHURA: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: Blip has changed its heading. And in a very leisurely manoeuvre.
They may not be aware of us. 
KIRK: Their invisibility screen may work both ways. With that kind of
power consumption, they may not be able to see us. 
SPOCK: His heading is now one eleven mark fourteen. The exact heading a
Romulan would take, Jim, for the Neutral Zone and home. 
KIRK: Parallel course. 
STILES: Don't you mean interception course, sir? 
KIRK: Negative. You and Mister Sulu will match its course and speed
with the object on our sensors exactly, move for move. If he has
sensors, I want him to think we're a reflection, an echo. Under no
circumstances are you to cross into the Neutral Zone without my direct
orders. 
SULU: Acknowledged, sir. 
KIRK: Cancel battle stations. All decks, standby alert. 
SULU: Cancel battle stations. 
STILES: Captain, may I respectfully remind the Captain what has
happened? The Romulans have crossed the Neutral Zone, attacked our
outposts, killed our men. 
KIRK: Mister Stiles. 
STILES: Add to that the fact it was a sneak attack. 
KIRK: Mister Stiles, are you questioning my orders? 
STILES: Negative, sir. I'm pointing our that we could have Romulan
spies aboard this ship. 
SULU: I agree, sir. Respectfully recommend all decks maintain security
alert. 
KIRK: Very well. All decks, security alert. 
SULU: Security alert, sir. 
UHURA: Picking up communication. It's from their ship. 
KIRK: Pipe it in. 
UHURA: Sounds like code, sir. 
SPOCK: I have a fix on it, Captain. I believe I can lock on it, get a
picture of their Bridge. 
KIRK: Put it on the screen. 
(Up shimmers an image of a group of four humanoids around a console.
One leaves his post and salutes the figure with his back to us. That
figure then turns, and we see someone who looks just like - a Vulcan.
Both Spock's eyebrows hit the ceiling. There's a long silence and a lot
of stares.)
KIRK: Decoding? 
UHURA: Cryptography is working on it, sir. 
STILES: Give it to Spock. 
KIRK: I didn't quite get that, Mister Stiles. 
STILES: Nothing, sir. 
KIRK: Repeat it. 
STILES: I was suggesting that Mister Spock could probably translate it
for you, sir. 
KIRK: I assume you're complimenting Mister Spock on his ability to
decode. 
STILES: I'm not sure, sir. 
KIRK: Well, here's one thing you can be sure of, Mister. Leave any
bigotry in your quarters. There's no room for it on the Bridge. Do I
make myself clear? 
STILES: You do, sir. 
UHURA: Transmission has been cut off. (to Spock) I made a tape of it,
sir. 
SPOCK: Very well. (runs the tape through his computer) 
SULU: Something visual ahead, Captain, at extreme range. He's changing
course, sir. 
KIRK: Stay with him, helm. 
SULU: Turning, sir. 
[Romulan ship]
(We're given a lovely shot of the bird painted on
it's belly) 
COMMANDER: We grow visible. Attend the cloaking system. 
ROMULAN: It consumes much power, Commander. With no enemy to concern
us. 
COMMANDER: That Earth outpost called to an Earth vessel. Now it follows
us. 
ROMULAN: Which neither retreats nor grows nearer. It turns as we turn.
Commander, it is our judgment we run from a reflection. 
COMMANDER: Perhaps so, but my judgment prevails. 
ROMULAN: Cloaking system on, sir. 
COMMANDER: It is good we approach the Neutral Zone. Not too soon for me
to see the stars of home. I know they are following. 
CENTURION: (an older man) If an Earth ship, why does he not attack? 
COMMANDER: First study the enemy, seek weakness. If I were their
commander, that is what I would do. 
DECIUS: My Commander sent for Decius. 
COMMANDER: A message was dispatched. You've broken the rule of silence.
DECIUS: Only in code, Commander. To inform our Praetor of this glorious
mission. 
COMMANDER: Your carelessness might have ended this glorious mission.
You're reduced two steps in rank. Return to post. 
CENTURION: Take care, Commander. He has friends, and friends of his
kind mean power. And power is danger. 
COMMANDER: Danger and I are old companions. 
CENTURION: We've seen a hundred campaigns together, and still I do not
understand you. 
COMMANDER: I think you do. No need to tell you what happens when we
reach home with proof of the Earthmen's weakness. And we will have
proof. The Earth commander will follow. He must. When he attacks, we
will destroy him. Our gift to the homeland, another war. 
CENTURION: If we are the strong, isn't this the signal for war? 
COMMANDER: Must it always be so? How many comrades have we lost in this
way? 
CENTURION: Our portion, Commander, is obedience. 
COMMANDER: Obedience. Duty. Death and more death. Soon even enough for
the Praetor's taste. Centurion, I find myself wishing for destruction
before we can return. Worry not. Like you, I am too well-trained in my
duty to permit it. Continue evasive manoeuvres. Now, back to the first
course. 
[Bridge]
SULU: They're turning, sir. We're staying with
them. 
SPOCK: Steady on one eleven mark fourteen. Back on their original
course, Captain, toward the Neutral Zone. 
KIRK: What's our position, navigator? 
STILES: We'll enter the Neutral Zone in less than an hour, sir.
Assuming, of course, that we don't turn back. 
SCOTT [OC]: We now have aboard debris from Outpost four, Captain. 
KIRK: Bring it to the briefing room. Are you ready, gentlemen? 
[Briefing room]
SPOCK: From the outpost's protective shield. Cast
rodinium. This is the hardest substance known to our science. 
(He crushes it with his hand) 
SPOCK: Lab theorises an enveloping energy plasma forcing an implosion. 
KIRK: Comments? 
SPOCK: Obviously, their weaponry is superior to ours, and they have a
practical invisibility screen. 
MCCOY: You're discussing tactics. Do you realise what this really comes
down to? Millions and millions of lives hanging on what this vessel
does. 
SPOCK: Or on what this vessel fails to do, Doctor. 
KIRK: Yes, well gentlemen, the question still remains. Can we engage
them with a reasonable possibility of victory? 
SCOTT: No question. Their power is simple impulse. 
KIRK: Meaning we can outrun them? 
STILES: To be used in chasing them or retreating, sir? 
KIRK: Go ahead, Mister Styles. I called this session for opinions. 
STILES: We have to attack immediately. 
KIRK: Explain. 
STILES: They're still on our side of the Neutral Zone. There would be
no doubt they broke the treaty. 
SULU: Attack, without a visible target? How do we aim our phasers? 
STILES: Aim with sensors. Not accurate, but if we blanket them 
SULU: And hope for a lucky shot before they zero in on us? 
STILES: And if we don't? Once back, they'll report that we saw their
weapons and ran. 
SULU: And if they could report they destroyed us? 
STILES: These are Romulans! You run away from them and you guarantee
war. They'll be back. Not just one ship but with everything they've
got. You know that, Mister Science Officer. You've the expert on these
people, always left out that one point. Why? I'm very interested in
why. 
KIRK: Sit down, Mister. 
SPOCK: I agree. Attack. 
KIRK: Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight? 
MCCOY: Based on what? Memories of a war over a century ago? On theories
about a people we've never even met face to face? 
STILES: We know what they look like. 
SPOCK: Yes, indeed we do, Mister Stiles. And if Romulans are an
offshoot of my Vulcan blood, and I think this likely, then attack
becomes even more imperative. 
MCCOY: War is never imperative, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: It is for them, Doctor. Vulcan, like Earth, had its aggressive
colonising period. Savage, even by Earth standards. And if Romulans
retain this martial philosophy, then weakness is something we dare not
show. 
SPOCK: Do you want a galactic war on your conscience? 
KIRK: Captain to Bridge. 
UHURA [OC]: This is Uhura, Captain. 
KIRK: What's our position? 
UHURA [OC]: Course unchanged, sir. Estimating treaty boundary in twenty
one minutes. 
KIRK: Are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports? 
UHURA [OC]: Affirmative, Captain. 
KIRK: And at this distance? 
UHURA [OC]: Approximately three hours before receiving a reply to our
first message. 
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Check our course ahead, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: A comet, magnitude seven, dead ahead, and the intruder changing
course toward it. 
KIRK: Comet Icarus four. Composition? 
SPOCK: Quite ordinary. An ionised mass, a trail of frozen vapour
particles. 
KIRK: And when an object passes through it, even an invisible object? 
SPOCK: It leaves a visible trail. 
KIRK: Our chance, gentlemen. Prepare to attack. All hands, battle
stations. I hope we won't need your services, Bones. 
MCCOY: Amen to that. We're taking a big gamble, Jim. 
[Bridge]
KIRK: Battle status? 
SULU: All stations manned, Captain. 
STILES: Phaser weapons energised. Set for proximity blast. 
SPOCK: Intruder now bearing directly for comet's tail. 
KIRK: Plot his exact point of entry, Mister Stiles. 
STILES: Computed. On the board, sir. 
KIRK: The moment he begins entering the comet's tail, he becomes
visible. End run, gentlemen. We'll swing around the other side and
catch him at that moment. 
SULU: Acknowledged, Captain. 
SPOCK: He's maintaining that bearing, Captain. 
KIRK: Let's get him, Mister Sulu. 
[Romulan ship]
COMMANDER: How pleasing to the eye it is. Behold a
marvel in the darkness. 
CENTURION: You spoke of entrapment. 
COMMANDER: Its many particles will obscure their sensing device,
Centurion. 
ROMULAN: We enter it, Commander. 
COMMANDER: Once fully obscured, we will turn suddenly back upon our
adversary. 
ROMULAN: At last the screen is clear, Commander. 
COMMANDER: Clear? 
ROMULAN: Our reflection no longer follows us. 
COMMANDER: Escape manoeuvre one, quickly! 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: We're losing sensor contact, Captain. 
KIRK: Steady as she goes. Phaser crews ready? 
SULU: Phaser crew signal ready, sir. 
KIRK: He'll only be visible for a moment. Stand by. 
SULU: Sir, nothing in 
KIRK: At the last moment he must have guessed our move. Hard to
starboard, helm! 
SULU: Hard to starboard. 
KIRK: He did exactly what I would have done. I won't underestimate him
again. Now, fire blind. Lay down a pattern. STILES: Traverse pattern.
All phasers fire. 
[Phaser control]
ROBERT: Phaser one, fire. 
CREWMAN: Phaser one, fire. 
(Pulse phaser shots go into the darkness, rocking the Romulan ship) 
ROBERT: Phaser two, fire. 
CREWMAN: Phaser two, fire. 
[Romulan ship]
(The Centurion pushes his Commander out of the way
of a falling beam) 
COMMANDER: Divert all power to weapons. 
[Bridge]
SULU: Phaser overload. Control circuit burnout. 
(Spock goes under his station to put out the flames) 
SPOCK: It'll take time to correct, sir. 
SULU: Captain, are they surrendering? 
(The Romulan ship has become visible) 
KIRK: Full astern! Emergency warp speed! 
(A red plasma blast is heading towards them) 
KIRK: Do we have emergency warp? 
SULU: Full power, sir. It's still overtaking us. If we can get one
phaser working, sir, one shot might detonate it. 
KIRK: Navigation? 
STILES: Estimate it'll overtake us in two minutes, sir. 
KIRK: Phasers, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Impossible, Captain. 
KIRK: Feed this to the space recorder and jettison immediately. 
RAND: Captain, should I continue log entry? 
KIRK: Yeoman. Affirmative. Continue log entries. 
RAND: Yes, sir. 
SULU: Ten seconds to impact. Captain, It's dissipating, sir. 
STILES: It must have a range limit. 
(Rand stands as close as humanly possible to Kirk) 
SULU: Five, four, three, two, one. Impact! 
(Everyone gets thrown about a bit) 
KIRK: Limited range. 
SPOCK: Phasers operational, Captain. Intruder bearing one eleven mark
fourteen. 
KIRK: Back to his old course. 
SPOCK: He may think we're destroyed, Captain. 
KIRK: I wouldn't make that assumption. I don't think their Captain will
either. 
SPOCK: Intruder holding steady. Course one eleven mark fourteen. 
KIRK: Same as before, Mister Sulu. Stay with him. 
[Romulan ship]
(The Commander tends to his injured friend) 
ROMULAN: Commander, the reflection returns. 
COMMANDER: Activate our cloak. 
ROMULAN: Commander, our fuel runs low. 
COMMANDER: Quickly! 
DECIUS: The Earth vessel? Impossible. 
ROMULAN: It moves as we move. 
COMMANDER: Its commander is not one to repeat a mistake. 
[Bridge]
STILES: We'll enter the Neutral Zone in one minute,
Captain. 
MCCOY: Do we violate the treaty, Captain? 
SPOCK: They did, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Once inside, they can claim we did. A set-up. They want war, we
furnish the provocation. 
SPOCK: We're still on our side, Captain. 
KIRK: Let's get them while we are. Before we enter the Neutral Zone.
Full ahead, Mister Sulu. Maximum warp. 
SULU: Ahead, sir. Maximum. 
KIRK: Phasers, stand by. 
STILES: Sir, at this distance? 
KIRK: We know their Achilles heel, Mister Stiles. Their weapon takes
all their energy. They must become visible in order to launch it. 
STILES: A phaser hit at this distance would be the wildest stroke of
luck. 
KIRK: I'm aware of that, Mister Stiles. Are phasers ready? 
STILES: Phasers show ready, sir. 
[Romulan ship]
ROMULAN: Commander! 
COMMANDER: Evasive action. The Earth ship again. 
(They are hit by phaser fire again) 
[Bridge]
STILES: Twenty seconds to Neutral Zone, sir. 
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, inform Command base, In my opinion, no option.
On my responsibility, we are proceeding into the Neutral Zone. Steady
as we go, Mister Sulu. Continue firing. 
[Romulan ship]
DECIUS: Commander, they stay within range. I will
tend to the centurion. 
COMMANDER: No need. The Centurion is dead. 
DECIUS: Why don't we fire, Commander? 
COMMANDER: No. No, he's shrewd, this starship commander. He tries to
make us waste energy. He has estimated we have only enough. It is time.
All debris into disposal tubes. 
DECIUS: Yes, Commander. 
COMMANDER: The body of the Centurion, too. Forgive me, my old friend,
but I must use all my experience now to get home. 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Motion sensor signal stopped. 
KIRK: Cease fire. 
SULU: Debris scatter ahead, sir. We've hit him. 
SPOCK: Vessel wreckage. Metal moulds, conduit, plastoform and a body,
Captain. However. 
KIRK: However? 
SPOCK: Insufficient mass, sir. 
KIRK: What? 
SPOCK: Simple debris. Not a vessel, a trick. 
KIRK: Go to sensor probes. 
SPOCK: Nothing, sir. No motion out there at all. We've lost them,
Captain. 
Captain's log, Stardate 1709.6. We are at the
Neutral Zone. Have lost contact with the intruder. No reaction on our
motion sensors
but believe the Romulan vessel to be somewhere close by. With all
engines and systems shut down, the Enterprise is also playing the
silent waiting game in hope of regaining contact. 
[Bridge]
(The lights are being dimmed and systems shut down
as they rig for silent running) 
SPOCK: Captain, I must make further repairs on the transfer coil. It's
giving out again. 
KIRK: All right, Mister Spock, work quietly. 
[Romulan ship]
DECIUS: Now twenty full cycles, Commander. Still no
sign. I say he's been fooled. He must have gone on. 
COMMANDER: Shh. He is there, somewhere. I feel it. 
Captain's log, supplemental. Now motionless for
nine hours, forty seven minutes. 
[Kirk's quarters]
(Yeoman Rand walks in without knocking, to find the
Captain lying on his bed.) 
RAND: Can I get you something from the galley, sir? Coffee, at least? 
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman. Bring it to the Bridge. I'll be there in a
moment. 
RAND: Yes, sir. 
(McCoy walks in unannounced, and Rand leaves.) 
KIRK: I wish I were on a long sea voyage somewhere. Not too much deck
tennis, no frantic dancing, and no responsibility. Why me? I look
around that Bridge, and I see the men waiting for me to make the next
move. And Bones, what if I'm wrong? 
MCCOY: Captain, I 
KIRK: No, I don't really expect an answer. 
MCCOY: But I've got one. Something I seldom say to a customer, Jim. In
this galaxy, there's a mathematical probability of three million
Earth-type planets. And in all of the universe, three million million
galaxies like this. And in all of that, and perhaps more, only one of
each of us. Don't destroy the one named Kirk. 
[Bridge]
(Spock carefully closes the cover on his repairs,
and is reaching up to his station to help himself up when he
accidentally touches a button, turning on a system) 
STILES: What? 
KIRK: It's all right. It's all right. 
[Romulan ship]
ROMULAN: A signal, Commander. 
COMMANDER: We have him. Move toward him. 
[Bridge]
KIRK: Power on. Reverse course. He'll try to slip
under us. 
SULU: Lateral power, sir. 
STILES: Coming around, sir. 
KIRK: Phasers, fire. 
STILES: Phasers, fire. 
[Romulan ship]
(They are taking damage) 
DECIUS: How, Commander. How? 
COMMANDER: He's a sorcerer, that one. He reads the thoughts in my
brain. Our fuel supply all but gone and he stays out of reach. 
DECIUS: We are beaten. Can it be true? The Praetor's finest and
proudest flagship beaten. 
COMMANDER: Perhaps we can yet save your Praetor's pride for him. More
debris into the tubes. Decius, do we have the old-style nuclear
warheads aboard? 
DECIUS: Yes Commander, but only for self-destruction. 
COMMANDER: Place one with the debris. Proximity fuse. 
DECIUS: Yes, Commander. At once. 
[Bridge]
SULU: More wreckage, sir, scattering across our
path. 
KIRK: Cease fire. 
SPOCK: Debris on our scanners. 
KIRK: Analysis, quickly. 
SPOCK: Same type as before, sir, except, one metal-cased object! 
KIRK: Helm, hard over. Phasers, fire point-blank. 
STILES: Phasers, fire! 
(There's a big explosion, everyone gets thrown across the Bridge.
Enterprise hangs crooked and motionless in space.)
[Romulan ship]
DECIUS: Glorious. Glorious. 
COMMANDER: Now we go home. 
DECIUS: They're at our mercy. Commander, I remind you of your duty. 
[Bridge]
KIRK: Captain to Sickbay. 
MCCOY [OC]: McCoy here. 
KIRK: Casualties? 
MCCOY [OC]: Twenty two so far. Mainly radiation burns, mostly from the
ship's outer areas. Could have been much, much worse, Captain. 
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor. (the lights come back on) Report, Mister
Spock? 
SPOCK: Nuclear device of some kind, sir. Our phasers detonated it less
than one hundred metres away. 
KIRK: Ship damage? 
SPOCK: Mainly overloads and circuit burnouts. 
KIRK: Weapons status? 
SCOTT [OC]: We've only the forward phaser room, Captain. 
KIRK: Fully operable, Scotty? 
SCOTT [OC]: Yes, sir. But Specialist Tomlinson is manning it alone. No
standby crew available. 
STILES: Sir, my first assignment was in weapons control. 
KIRK: Go. Lieutenant Uhura, take over navigation. 
UHURA: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK: We have engine power now, Captain, if you'd like to move off and
make repairs. 
KIRK: Maybe we can pull them back to our side of the Neutral Zone. Hold
our position. Play dead. 
[Romulan ship]
DECIUS: Still no sign of movement, Commander. 
COMMANDER: We've damaged ourselves. Our fuel reserve is gone. 
DECIUS: And it is our duty to crush the Praetor's enemies. 
COMMANDER: I do not trust their Captain. 
DECIUS: We are in the Neutral Zone. They will not enter. If you refuse,
permit me the glory of the kill, Commander. 
COMMANDER: We will attack, but on my order. 
[Phaser control]
SPOCK: Damage reports, Mister Stiles? 
STILES: Negative. 
SPOCK: Will you require assistance here? 
STILES: This time, we'll handle things without your help, Vulcan. 
(Spock leaves. then Stiles notices purple gas escaping from a seal) 
STILES: Tomlinson! 
[Bridge]
SULU: Enemy vessel becoming visible, sir. 
KIRK: Forward phasers, stand by. (the Romulan becomes a clear image)
Fire! Fire! Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! 
[Corridor]
(Spock is walking slowly when he hears the
Captain's commands over the intercom) 
KIRK [OC]: Fire! Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! 
(Spock turns and runs back to Phaser Control) 
KIRK [OC]: Fire! 
[Phaser Control]
(The room is full of purple smoke) 
KIRK: Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Stiles! 
(Spock enters just as Stiles tries and fails to reach the firing
button. He activates the controls and the phaser pulses hit the Romulan
ship) 
[Bridge]
KIRK: Mister Sulu, prepare to move in on the
Romulan vessel. Ship-to-ship, Uhura. Put this on the screen. 
UHURA: (still at the navigation station) Hailing frequencies open, sir.
(The viewscreen shows a wrecked room and just the Commander still on
his feet) 
KIRK: Captain. Standing by to beam your survivors aboard our ship.
Prepare to abandon your vessel. 
COMMANDER [on viewscreen]: No. No, that is not our way. I regret that
we meet in this way. You and I are of a kind. In a different reality, I
could have called you friend. 
KIRK: What purpose will it serve to die? 
COMMANDER [on viewscreen]: We are creatures of duty, Captain. I have
lived my life by it. Just one more duty to perform. 
(He goes to the control console, turns a switch, and the whole ship
explodes)
[Sickbay]
KIRK: Are you all right, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Yes, very well, thank you, Captain. 
KIRK: And you, Stiles? 
STILES: I'm alive, sir. But I wouldn't be. Mister Spock pulled me out
of the phaser room. He saved my life. He risked his life after I 
SPOCK: I saved a trained navigator so he could return to duty. I am
capable of no other feelings in such matters. 
KIRK: How many men did we lose, Bones? 
MCCOY: Only one. Tomlinson. The boy who was getting married this
morning. His fiancée
is at the chapel. 
(Kirk turns to go, and Rand enters) 
RAND: We finally received an answer from Command base, sir. They say
they'll support whatever decision you have to make. 
(Kirk leaves)
[Ship's Chapel]
(Angela is kneeling in front of the altarpiece,
crying, when Kirk enters. She gets up and hugs him.) 
KIRK: It never makes any sense. We both have to know that there was a
reason. 
ANGELA: I'm all right.

  [Bridge]
 (Enterprise is orbiting a very green planet, and a
young female Yeoman is getting a signature from the Captain.) 
KIRK: Anything from the landing party? 
SPOCK: They should be sending up a report momentarily, Captain. (Kirk
stretches and groans) Something wrong?
KIRK: A kink in my back. (behind his back the Yeoman starts to massage
it) That's it. A little higher, please. Push. Push hard. Dig it in
there, Mister 
(Spock steps forward and Kirk realises who is massaging his lower back)
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman. That's sufficient.
TONIA: You need sleep, Captain. If it's not out of line
KIRK: I have enough of that from Doctor McCoy, Yeoman. Thank you.
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. After what this ship has been
through in the last three months, there is not a crewman aboard who is
not in need of rest. Myself excepted, of course.
KIRK: Have Doctor McCoy's report channeled to my quarters, Lieutenant.
UHURA: Aye, aye, Captain.
[Planet surface - Glade]
SULU: Beautiful, beautiful. No animals, no people,
no worries. Just what the doctor ordered. Right, Doctor?
MCCOY: I couldn't have prescribed better. We are one weary ship.
SULU: Do you think the Captain will authorise shore leave here?
MCCOY: Depending upon my report and that of the other scouting parties.
You know, you have to see this place to believe it. It's like something
out of Alice in Wonderland. The Captain has to come down.
SULU: He'd like it.
MCCOY: He needs it. You've got your problems, I've got mine. He's got
ours, plus his, plus four hundred and thirty other people's. Where are
you going?
SULU: To get some cell-structure records. A blade of grass, a bush, a
tree, a flower petal. With these, we can tell the whole planet's
biology.
(As Sulu crouches down behind some pampas grass, McCoy turns and looks
straight at a white rabbit in a check jacket, yellow waistcoat, and
looking at a gold pocket-watch.)
RABBIT: Oh, my paws and whiskers! I'll be late. 
(It heads off down a hole. Then a young girl comes running up, wearing
a blue dress with a white apron.)
ALICE: Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a rather large white rabbit with a
yellow waistcoat and white gloves here about?
(Wordlessly, McCoy points in the direction the rabbit went. The girl
curtseys nicely) 
ALICE: Thank you very much. 
(She runs off after the rabbit) 
MCCOY: Sulu!
SULU: What is it? What's the matter?
MCCOY: Did you see them?
SULU: See what? I don't see anything. What is it, Doc? 
[Kirk's quarters]
(The Captain is dictating his log in the presence
of Yeoman Tonia Barrows) 
KIRK: Captain's log. Stardate 3025 er, point 3. We are orbiting an
uninhabited planet in the Omicron Delta region. A planet remarkably
like Earth, or how we remember Earth to be. Park-like, beautiful,
green, flowers, trees, green lawn, quiet and restful. Almost too good
to be true. 
TONIA: Sir, I don't see your name in any of the shore parties.
KIRK: I may be tired, Yeoman, but I'm not falling apart. Dismissed.
TONIA: Aye, aye, sir.
(She leaves, and Spock enters) 
KIRK: Mister Spock, we're beaming down the starboard section first.
Which section would you like to go with?
SPOCK: Not necessary in my case, Captain. On my planet, to rest is to
rest, to cease using energy. To me, it is quite illogical to run up and
down on green grass using energy instead of saving it.
(Intercom whistles) 
KIRK: Kirk here.
UHURA [OC]: Doctor McCoy calling from the planet, Captain.
KIRK: Yes. Open a channel, Uhura.
UHURA [OC]: Aye, aye, sir.
[Glade]
MCCOY: Captain, are you beaming down?
[Kirk's quarters]
KIRK: I hadn't planned to, Bones. Why? 
[Glade]
MCCOY: Well, either our scouting probes and
detectors are malfunctioning, and all us scouts careless and
beauty-intoxicated, or I must report myself unfit for duty. 
[Kirk's quarters]
KIRK: Explain.
[Glade]
MCCOY: On this supposedly uninhabited planet, I
just saw a large rabbit 
[Kirk's quarters]
MCCOY [OC]: Pull a gold watch from his vest and
claim that he was late. 
KIRK: That's pretty good. I got one for you. The rabbit was followed by
a little blonde girl, right? 
[Glade]
MCCOY: As a matter of fact, yes. 
[Kirk's quarters]
MCCOY [OC]: And they disappeared through a hole in
a hedge.
KIRK: All right, Doctor, I'll take your report under consideration.
Captain out. That's a McCoy pill, with a little mystery sugar-coating.
He wants to get me down there. I'm afraid I won't swallow it.
SPOCK: Very well, Captain. Something I did come to discuss.
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?
SPOCK: I picked this up from Doctor McCoy's log. We have a crewmember
aboard who's showing signs of stress and fatigue. Reaction time down
nine to twelve percent, associational reading norm minus three.
KIRK: That's much too low a rating. 
SPOCK: He's becoming irritable and quarrelsome, yet he refuses to take
rest and rehabilitation. Now, He has that right, but we've found 
KIRK: A crewman's right ends where the safety of the ship begins. That
man will go a shore on my orders. What's his name?
SPOCK: James Kirk. Enjoy yourself, Captain. It's an interesting planet.
You'll find it quite pleasant. Very much like your Earth. 
[Planet surface]
(An establishing shot of a landscape) 
SPOCK [OC]: Scouts have detected no animals, artefacts, or force fields
of any kind. Only peace, sunshine, and good air. You'll have no
problems.
(But as these words are spoken, a rock raises itself to reveal a
classic western-style six shooter gun.) 
(Elsewhere, a man and a woman are taking scans of the vegetation) 
TELLER: (the woman) Does it always have to be work with you? There's so
much loveliness. 
RODRIGUEZ: You won't find all this so lovely if our report for the
Captain isn't ready when he asks for it, which shouldn't be long.
(Kirk and Barrows beam down) 
KIRK: Rodriguez, Teller, everything all right?
RODRIGUEZ: Yes, sir. We've completed the specimen survey.
KIRK: Good. That should be sufficient. Beam it up to Mister Spock when
you're ready, and start enjoying yourselves.
RODRIGUEZ: Thank you, sir. And sir, I think you'll find Doctor McCoy
and Mister Sulu that way.
KIRK: Thank you.
(Walking along) 
KIRK: Restful. After what we've been through, it's hard to believe a
place this beautiful exists. 
TONIA: It is beautiful. So lovely, and restful. I mean, affirmative,
Captain. 
KIRK: McCoy! McCoy! 
MCCOY: Over here. Over here.
(They meet up by the lake) 
KIRK: Bones, know any good rabbit jokes lately?
MCCOY: As a matter of fact, I do, but this is not one of them. Look at
this. (a pair of large tracks in the soil) I saw what I saw, or maybe I
hallucinated it, but I want you to take a look and tell me what you
think about it. 
KIRK: Footprints. Could be a rabbit. It would have to be an unusual
creature to make this size tracks. What about Mister Sulu? Will he
confirm what you saw?
MCCOY: Negative. He was examining the flora at the time.
KIRK: Bridge, this is the Captain.
TONIA: Where is Mister Sulu?
MCCOY: Collecting specimens.
UHURA [OC]: Bridge.
KIRK: Has the first shore party beamed down yet?
UHURA: Negative, Captain. They're just about to start.
KIRK: Get this message to all shore parties. Stand by. No one is to
leave the ship.
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.
MCCOY: You're cancelling the shore leave on account of this, Jim? 
KIRK: You're the doctor, Doctor. Can you explain this?
MCCOY: Well, no. 
KIRK: Neither can I. I admit it looks harmless. It probably is
harmless. But before I bring my people down here, I want proof it's
harmless.
(They hear a gunshot. Kirk draws his phaser and they head off in the
direction of the shot. More are fired.)
[Woodland path]
(They find Sulu target practising) 
KIRK: What do you think you're doing?
SULU: Target shooting, Captain. Isn't it a beauty? Haven't got anything
like this in my collection.
KIRK: Where did you get it, Mister Sulu?
SULU: I found it. I know it's a crazy coincidence, but I've always
wanted one like this. Found it lying right over there. An old-time
police special, and in beautiful condition. Hasn't been one like this
made in a couple of centuries.
KIRK: (holding out his hand for the offending weapon) Mister Sulu.
SULU: (handing it over) It fires lead pellets propelled by expanding
gases from a chemical explosion.
KIRK: I'll hang on to it. The fresh air seems to have made you
trigger-happy.
TONIA: Doctor McCoy's rabbit, sir. He must have gone through here.
KIRK: Are you sure our instruments didn't show any animal life on this
planet?
MCCOY: Absolutely. No birds, no mammals, no insects, nothing. I'm
certain our readings weren't off.
KIRK: I'd like to believe this is an elaborate gag, but. Yeoman
Barrows, you accompany Mister Sulu. Find out where those tracks came
from. Doctor, you come with me back to the glade. I'd like another look
at that area. 
(As they head back, an aerial comes up in front of our point of view
and follows them.) 
KIRK: This is turning out to be one very unusual shore leave.
MCCOY: Well, it could have been worse.
KIRK: How?
MCCOY: You could have seen the rabbit.
KIRK: What's the matter, Bones, you getting a persecution complex?
MCCOY: Well, yeah, I'm beginning to feel a little bit picked on, if
that's what you mean. 
KIRK: I know the feeling very well. I had it at the Academy. An upper
classman there. One practical joke after another, and always on me. My
own personal devil. A guy by the name of Finnegan.
MCCOY: And you being the very serious young 
KIRK: Serious? I'll make a confession, Bones. I was absolutely grim,
which delighted Finnegan no end. He's the kind of guy to put a bowl of
cold soup in your bed or a bucket of water propped on a half-open door.
You never knew where he'd strike next. More tracks. Looks like your
rabbit came from over there.
MCCOY: A girl's footprints. The young blonde girl I saw chasing it.
KIRK: Yes. You follow the rabbit. I'll backtrack the girl. I'll meet
you around the other side of the hill.
MCCOY: Good. I've got a personal grudge against that rabbit, Jim. 
(They split up, and then suddenly there's a young man leaning against a
tree trunk) 
FINNEGAN: (in a dreadful cod-Irish accent) Jim.
KIRK: Finnegan? I can't believe it. 
FINNEGAN: You never know when I'm going to strike, huh, Jim? (hits him
on the jaw) How's this? Come on, come on. It's me, Finnegan. All right,
Jimmy boy. (maniacal laughter) Go ahead, lay one on me. That's what you
always wanted, isn't it? Come on. Come on. 
KIRK: All right, let's try that one again. Go! 
(He just lays hands on Finnegan for a good fight, when they hear
screams. Kirk runs off to investigate) 
FINNEGAN: Go! Any excuse, Jim baby. Run away! Run away! Run away! 
(Along the path, he meets McCoy) 
MCCOY: What was it?
KIRK: Yeoman Barrows. 
(They arrive on the scene to find Tonia disheveled, her uniform torn,
hugging a tree) 
KIRK: What happened?
TONIA: I don't know. I mean I do know. I was following the tracks, and
there he was.
KIRK: Who was?
TONIA: Him.
KIRK: Barrows, give me a report.
TONIA: He had a cloak, sir, and a dagger with jewels on it.
KIRK: Are you sure you're not imagining all this?
TONIA: Captain, I know it sounds incredible, but I did not imagine it
any more than I imagined he did this.
MCCOY: Sounds like Don Juan.
TONIA: Yes. Yes. It was so sort of story book walking around here, and
I was thinking, all a girl needs is Don Juan. Just day dreaming, the
way you would about someone you'd like to meet.
KIRK: Mister Sulu was with you. Where is he now?
TONIA: He ran after him.
KIRK: Stay with her, Doctor.
(He heads off in the direction she indicates) 
KIRK: Mister Sulu! Sulu! 
(An aerial comes up from a rock and monitors him as he runs along the
path) 
KIRK: Mister Sulu! Sulu! 
[Rocky outcrop]
(The Captain runs across a barren piece of ground
towards a rocky outcrop, which suddenly gains palms and banana plants
when he gets there.)
KIRK: Sulu!
(He picks an orange flower, and becomes wistful. And there she is,
blonde and lovely, her dress half white, half black and roses.) 
KIRK: Ruth? Ruth.
RUTH: Jim, darling, it is me. It is Ruth. 
(She kisses him) 
Captain's log. Stardate 3025.8. Investigation of
this increasingly unusual planet continues, and we are seeing things
that cannot possibly exist, yet they are undeniably real.
[Rocky outcrop]
KIRK: (into communicator) McCoy, do you read me?
Ruth. Ruth, how can it be you? How could you possibly be here? You
haven't aged. It's been fifteen years.
RUTH: It doesn't matter. None of that matters.
(His communicator beeps) 
KIRK: Kirk here.
MCCOY [OC]: Did you find Mister Sulu, Captain?
KIRK: What?
MCCOY [OC]: Did you find Mister Sulu?
KIRK: No, but I'm sure he's all right.
MCCOY [OC]: Sir? Are you all right?
KIRK: Yes, I'm fine.
RODRIQUEZ [OC]: Rodriguez to Captain Kirk.
KIRK: Yes, Mister Rodriguez.
RODRIQUEZ [OC]: Captain, a while ago, I saw well, birds, a whole flock
of them.
KIRK: Don't you like birds, Mister Rodriguez?
RODRIQUEZ [OC]: I like them fine, sir, but all our surveys showed
KIRK; Then offhand I'd say our instruments are defective. There are
indeed life-forms on this planet.
RODRIQUEZ [OC]: Sir, our surveys couldn't have been that wrong.
KIRK: Mister Rodriguez, have the search parties rendezvous at the
glade. I'd like some answers to all this.
RODRIQUEZ [OC]: Aye, aye, sir. 
RUTH: You have to go?
KIRK: I don't want to.
RUTH: You'll see me again if you want to.
KIRK: You haven't told me. You haven't told me 
RUTH: Do what you have to do, and I'll be waiting.
KIRK: Ruth. 
(communicator beeps) 
KIRK: Kirk here.
SPOCK [OC]: Captain.
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock. 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: I'm getting strange readings from the planet
surface, Captain. Some sort of power field down there.
[Rocky outcrop]
KIRK: Specify. 
SPOCK [OC]: A highly sophisticated type of energy draining our power
and increasing, beginning to affect our communications.
KIRK: Can you pinpoint the source? 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Could be coming from beneath the planet's
surface. Patterns indicate some sort of industrial activity. 
[Rocky outcrop]
KIRK: Keep me posted, Mister Spock. We'll continue
our investigation down here. Captain out. 
(He walks off) 
[Woodland path]
(Meanwhile, back at the tree where Tonia met Don
Juan, something is monitoring them. The couple go walking arm in arm
through the tropical plants.) 
MCCOY: Feeling better?
TONIA: A little, but I wouldn't want to be alone here.
MCCOY: It's a beautiful place. A little strange, I'll admit.
TONIA: That's just it. It's almost too beautiful. I was thinking, even
before my tunic was torn, that in a place like this a girl should be,
oh let's see now,
a girl should be dressed like a fairy-tale princess, with lots of
floaty stuff and a tall hat with a veil.
MCCOY: I see what you mean, but then you'd have whole armies of Don
Juans to fight off. And me, too.
TONIA: Is that a promise, Doctor? 
(He takes her hands in his, and they gaze into each others eyes for a
long second. Then she spots her dream clothing hanging on some shrubs) 
TONIA: Oh, Doctor, they're lovely. Look at me, Doctor. A lady to be
protected and fought for. A princess of the blood royale.
MCCOY: You are all of those things and many more. They'll look even
lovelier with you wearing them.
TONIA: Doctor, I'm afraid.
MCCOY: Now, look, I don't know how or why, but the dress is here. I'd
like to see you in it. Why don't you put it on?
TONIA: All right, but you stay right there. Don't peek.
MCCOY: My dear girl, I am a doctor. When I peek, it's in the line of
duty.
(he turns his back on her, and his communicator beeps) 
RODRIGUEZ [OC]: Calling Doctor McCoy.
MCCOY: McCoy here. I can't read you very well. Is this Rodriguez?
RODRIGUEZ [OC]: This is all the volume I can get on this thing. Can't
read you well, either. Captain's orders. Rendezvous at that glade where
he first found you.
MCCOY: Right. What the devil's wrong with communications? Esteban.
Esteban.
(But Esteban and Teller have problems of their own - a tiger has them
trapped) 
RODRIQUEZ: Doctor. Doctor. Doctor McCoy! 
(The tiger gets bored and leaves. Tonia emerges from her changing room
looking lovely, and happy in her Disney fantasy creation.)
[Bridge]
 KIRK [OC]: You're the science officer, Mister
Spock. I want some answers. 
[Rocky outcrop]
KIRK: First there was McCoy's Alice in Wonderland
where there was supposedly no animal life. And Sulu's gun where there's
no refined metal detected. Rodriguez' birds. And then my, well, the two
people I saw. 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Any chance these could be hallucinations? 
[Rocky outcrop]
KIRK: One hallucination flattened me with a clout
on the jaw. 
[Bridge]
KIRK [OC]: The other. 
SPOCK: That sounds like a painful reality.
[Rocky outcrop]
KIRK: Yes.
SPOCK [OC]: There must be some logical explanation. 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Your signal is very weak. Can you turn up
your gain?
KIRK [OC]: I'm already on maximum.
SPOCK: Captain, shall I beam down an armed party? 
[Rocky outcrop]
 KIRK: Negative. Our people here are armed with
phasers. Besides, there's yet to be any real danger. (he sees geese
flying overhead) Captain out.
[Cliff face]
(Sulu walks along by a cliff face, a hatch opens in
the ground and out comes a Samurai to attack him. Sulu's phaser doesn't
work and he is forced to dodge the long, sharp sword) 
[Rocky outcrop]
KIRK: McCoy. McCoy, do you read me? Kirk to McCoy.
Come in. 
(Sulu comes running over the rocks towards him) 
SULU: Captain, take cover! There's a Samurai after me. 
KIRK: A what? 
SULU: I mean, there was. (no one is chasing him now) Captain, you've
got to believe me.
KIRK: I do. I've met some interesting personalities myself. Have you
seen any of the others while I've been gone?
SULU: Got a call a few minutes ago. Rodriguez. Said you were
rendezvousing back at the glade.
KIRK: I hope he got through to everybody. Communications are almost out.
SULU: That's not all. So's my phaser. 
(Kirk checks his own weapon - nothing) KIRK: Yeah. We'd better get to
the glade.
SULU: Yes, sir. (sound of a transporter beam) Look. Someone beaming
down from the bridge.
KIRK: Trying to. Something's obstructing it. (finally the familiar
shape fully materialises) Mister Spock, my orders were no one was to
leave the ship. 
SPOCK: Necessary, Captain. Unable to contact you by communicator, and
the transporter is useless to us now. As I told you before, there's an
unusual power field down here. It's soaking up all the energy at the
source. I calculated the rate of its growth, and reasoned that I just
might be able to transport one more person.
KIRK: Good. We can use your help.
SULU: We're stranded down here, Captain?
KIRK: Until we can find out what this is all about. 
[Glade]
TONIA: There's no one here.
MCCOY: This is where the Captain said to rendezvous. (makes Tonia stand
with her back to a tree) I swear I heard someone moving around.
TONIA: Don't talk like that. 
MCCOY: A princess shouldn't be afraid, not with a brave knight to
protect her.
[Rocky outcrop]
(The trio hear the snarl of a big cat) 
KIRK: That way. Spread out. Let's find it. 
[Glade]
(A knight in armour on a black horse has appeared,
and is coming towards them.) 
MCCOY: These things cannot be real. Hallucinations can't harm us. Go
back to where you were. 
(Kirk and Spock arrive on the scene. The knight lowers his lance,
charges, and runs McCoy through. Tonia screams. Spock draws his phaser,
and Kirk the gun he confiscated from Sulu. He shoots the knight from
his horse, then they run to McCoy.) 
TONIA: He's dead.
Captain's log, supplemental. All contact with the
Enterprise has been lost. We're trapped here. Our ship's surgeon, my
personal friend, is dead. We're certain now that whatever we're facing
is terribly real.
[Glade]
TONIA: It's my fault. It never would have happened.
It's my fault. 
KIRK: No. 
TONIA: It is, it is. I'm to blame.
KIRK: Yeoman! We're in trouble. I need every crewman alert and thinking.
TONIA: Aye, aye, sir.
SULU: (at the knight's body) Captain! Captain!
(Kirk goes over) 
SULU: You'd better have a look at this, sir. (the knight is a plastic
dummy) I don't understand.
KIRK: Neither do I, Mister Sulu, but before we leave this planet, I
will.
SULU: It's like a dummy, Captain. It couldn't be alive.
KIRK: Tricorder?
SULU: Still operating, sir.
KIRK: Mister Spock. (Spock and Sulu swap places, handing over the
tricorder) What do you make of that?
SPOCK: This is not human skin tissue, Captain. It more closely
resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs. Much finer, of
course.
KIRK: I want an exact judgment, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: This is definitely a mechanical contrivance. It has the same
basic cell structure as the plants here, even the trees, the grass.
KIRK: Are you saying this is a plant, Mister Spock?
SPOCK: I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings. The
plants, the animals, the people. They're all being manufactured.
KIRK: By who? And why? And why these particular things?
SPOCK: All we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real
thing. Just as pleasant or just as deadly.
(There's a buzzing sound in the air, and a plane flies overhead) 
[Woodland path]
TELLER: What is it?
RODRIGUEZ: Of all the crazy things. Remember what I was telling you a
while ago, about the early wars and funny air vehicles they used?
That's one of them.
TELLER: Can it hurt us?
RODRIGUEZ: Not unless it makes a strafing run.
TELLER: A what?
RODRIGUEZ: The way they used to attack people on the ground. (the plane
descends) Come on.
(They run along the path, as a second plane joins the first, straight
into a clump of trees. Angela falls to the ground having hit the tree.)
RODRIGUEZ: Angela. 
[Glade]
(Everyone has been watching the air show, then Sulu
notices...) 
SULU: Captain!
KIRK: McCoy's body? 
SULU: He's gone. Dragged off. 
TONIA: The black knight, too.
KIRK: Spock?
SPOCK: At this point, Captain, my analysis may not sound very
scientific. 
KIRK: McCoy's death is a scientific fact. 
SPOCK: There is one slight possibility, very slim, but nevertheless.
Captain, what were your thoughts just before you encountered the people
you described? 
KIRK: I was, I was thinking about the Academy. My days 
FINNEGAN: Hey, Jim baby! I see you brought out reinforcements. Ha!
Well, I'm waiting for you, Jimmy boy.
KIRK: Finnegan. Finnegan! What's been happening to my people?
(Finnegan laughs and runs off) 
KIRK: Take Sulu. Find McCoy's body. This man is my problem.
SPOCK: Captain, wait.
KIRK: That's an order, Mister Spock.
(He runs off after Finnegan) 
FINNEGAN: Here I am! Run! 
[Rocky outcrop]
FINNEGAN: Jim! Find me! Can't you see me? Come and
get me! Here I am! Come on. You never could find your head with both
hands! Like it used to be, Jimmy. Remember? (finally Kirk catches up to
him, because he's lounging on a ledge) Hey, Jim 
KIRK: I want some answers.
FINNEGAN: Coming up. 
(He jumps on Kirk and they have a fight. Finnegan knocks Kirk down) 
FINNEGAN: Get up. Get up. Get up. Always fight fair, don't you? True
officer and gentleman, you. You stupid underclassman. I've got the
edge. I'm still twenty years old. Look at you. You're an old man.
(The fight resumes, and Kirk punches Finnegan till he falls down a
rocky slope and ends up writhing in pain) 
FINNEGAN: I can't move me leg. I can't feel me leg. My back is broken.
You've broken me back. 
KIRK: Can you feel that? 
(He gets kicked to the ground) 
FINNEGAN: Can you feel that, now? (Kirk passes out) Sleep sweet, Jimmy
boy. Sleep as long as you like. Sleep forever, Jim boy. Forever and
forever. 
(A little later, Kirk regains consciousness) 
FINNEGAN: Won't you ever learn, Jim boy? You never could take me, you
know.
KIRK: Finnegan. One thing
FINNEGAN: Sure. Name it.
KIRK: Answers.
FINNEGAN: Earn them! 
(He throws dirt in Kirk's face and the exchange of punches resumes
until they're both too tired to continue.) 
FINNEGAN: Not bad. Kind of makes up for things, huh, Jim?
KIRK: A lot of things. What's been happening to my people?
FINNEGAN: I never answer questions from plebes, Jimmy boy.
KIRK: I'm not a plebe. This is today, fifteen years later. What are you
doing here?
FINNEGAN: I'm being exactly what you expect me to be, Jimmy boy.
(Kirk lands the final haymaker that knocks Finnegan out cold) 
SPOCK: Did you enjoy it, Captain?
KIRK: Yes, I enjoyed it. After all these years. (realisation dawns) I
did enjoy it. The one thing I wanted to do after all these years was to
beat the tar out of Finnegan.
SPOCK: Which supports a theory I've been formulating. 
KIRK: That we're all meeting people and things that we happen to be
thinking about at the moment.
SPOCK: Yes. Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly
manufactured and provided for us.
KIRK: Dangerous if we happen to be thinking about 
SPOCK: Yes. We must all control our thoughts. 
KIRK: Difficult. 
SPOCK: The force field we encountered is obviously underground,
manufacturing these things. Passages lead to the surface. Just for
example, when Rodriguez thought of a tiger 
KIRK: Spock. 
(The tiger is behind them, the chain around it's neck tethering it to
the spot clearly visible) 
KIRK: We've got to get back to the landing party and warn them. 
(They start to run back to the glade. The aircraft strafe them, Kirk
elbows the Samurai out of his way) 
[Glade]
(Tonia has changed back into her uniform when Don
Juan sneaks up behind her and grabs her, warding off Sulu and Rodriquez
with his sword) 
KIRK: Sulu, Rodriguez, Barrows. Front and centre.
(Don Juan runs off) 
SULU: Sir. 
KIRK: Don't ask any questions, Sulu. Face front, everyone. Don't talk.
Don't breathe. Don't think. You're at attention. Concentrate on that
and only that. Concentrate.
SPOCK: Captain.
(A smiling grey-haired man in a long green robe walks up to Kirk) 
KIRK: Who are you?
CARETAKER: I'm the caretaker of this place, Captain Kirk.
KIRK: You know my name?
CARETAKER: But of course. Lieutenant Rodriguez, Lieutenant Sulu, Yeoman
Barrows and Mister Spock. We've just discovered you don't understand
all this. These experiences were intended to amuse you.
KIRK: Amuse? That's your word for what we've been through?
CARETAKER: But none of this is permanent. Here you have to only imagine
your fondest wishes, either old ones you wish to relive or new ones,
anything at all. Battle, fear, love, triumph. Anything that pleases you
can be made to happen.
SPOCK: The term is amusement park.
CARETAKER: Of course.
SPOCK: An old Earth name for a place where people could go to see and
do all sorts of fascinating things. 
CARETAKER: This entire planet was constructed for our race of people to
come and play.
SULU: Play? As advanced as you obviously are, and you still play?
KIRK: Yes, play, Mister Sulu. The more complex the mind, the greater
the need for the simplicity of play.
CARETAKER: Exactly, Captain. How very perceptive of you.
KIRK: But that still doesn't explain the death of my ship's surgeon.
MCCOY: Possibly because no one has died, Jim. (Strolls in with a lovely
girl on each arm) I was taken below the surface for some rather
remarkable repairs. It's amazing. They've got a factory complex down
there you wouldn't believe. They can build or do anything immediately.
TONIA: (not amused) And how do you explain them?
MCCOY: Oh. Them. Well I, er, I was thinking about a little cabaret I
know on Rigel Two, and, er, there were these two girls in the chorus
line. And well, here they are. Well after all, I am on shore leave.
TONIA: And so am l.
MCCOY: Oh, yes. So you are. Well, girls, I suppose you can turn
something up.
(The cabaret girls go to Sulu and Spock.) 
CARETAKER: We regret that some of you've been made uncomfortable.
KIRK: You say your people built all this. Who are you? What planet are
you from?
CARETAKER: My impression is that your race is not yet ready to
understand us, Captain.
SPOCK: I tend to agree.
(a communicator beeps) 
KIRK: Kirk here.
UHURA [OC]: This is the bridge, Captain. Our power systems have just
come back in. Do you require assistance?
KIRK: No, everything is in order, Lieutenant. Stand by.
CARETAKER: However. 
UHURA [OC]: Aye, aye, sir.
CARETAKER: If you would use the proper caution, this amusement planet
of ours could be an ideal place for your people to enjoy themselves, if
you wish.
MCCOY: It's what the doctor ordered, Jim.
KIRK: Lieutenant. 
UHURA [OC]: Sir?
KIRK: Commence transporting shore leave parties. Tell them to prepare
for the best shore leave they've ever had. Kirk out.
SPOCK: (handing the girl over to Sulu) Captain, I'll go back aboard
ship and take over. With all due respect to the young lady, I've
already had as much shore leave as I care for.
KIRK: No, Mister Spock. I'll go. You. (then he sees Ruth walking
towards the group) On the other hand, I'll stay for a day or two. 
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Did you enjoy your rest, gentlemen?
KIRK: Yes, we did, Mister Spock. I think we did.
MCCOY: Indeed we did, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Most illogical.
KIRK: Ahead warp factor one, Mister Sulu.

The Star Trek Transcripts - The Galileo Seven
The
Galileo Seven
Stardate:
2821.5
Original Airdate: 5 Jan, 1967
 
Captain's Log, stardate 2821.5. On route to Makus Three with a cargo of
medical supplies. Our course leads us past Murasaki 312, a quasar-like
formation, vague, undefined. A priceless opportunity for scientific
investigation. On board is Galactic High Commissioner Ferris,
overseeing the deliver of the medicines to Makus Three. 
 [Bridge] 
 KIRK: Captain to shuttlecraft Galileo. Stand by,
Mister Spock. 
FERRIS: I remind you, Captain, I'm entirely opposed to this delay. Your
mission is to get those emergency medical supplies to Makus Three in
time for their transfer to the New Paris colonies. 
KIRK: No problem, Commissioner. And may I remind you that I have
standing orders to investigate all quasars and quasar-like phenomena
wherever they may be encountered. Besides, it's three days to Makus.
And the rendezvous doesn't take place for five. 
FERRIS: I don't like to take chances. The plague is out of control on
New Paris. We must get those drugs there on time. 
KIRK: No problem. Captain to Galileo. All systems cleared for take off.
[Shuttlecraft]
(The NCC1701/7 is in the hangar bay preparing to
launch.) 
SPOCK: Power up. All instruments activated. All readings normal. All
go. 
[Bridge]
KIRK: Launch shuttlecraft. 
(The curved doors at the stern of the engineering deck open, and the
little vessel heads out into space) 
[Shuttlecraft]
MEARS: Readings normal. Acceleration normal. Phase
one separation normal. 
SPOCK: Position? 
LATIMER: Three point seven. Sir, I 
SPOCK: Make up your mind please, Mister Latimer. 
LATIMER: Sir, this indicator's gone crazy. 
BOMA: That's to be expected, Mister Spock. Quasars are extremely
disruptive. Just how much, we don't know. 
SPOCK: Considerably, Mister Boma. 
MEARS: Mister Spock, radiation is increasing. 
SPOCK: Stop forward momentum, Mister Latimer. 
LATIMER: I can't, sir. Nothing happens. 
SPOCK: Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. 
BOMA: Ionic interference, Mister Spock. 
MCCOY: We're being drawn right into it. 
SPOCK: Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. We are out of
control, being pulled directly into the heart of Murasaki three one
two. Being hit by violent radiation on outer hull. Course three point
two five 
[Bridge]
KIRK: Anything at all? 
UHURA: Nothing clear, Captain. Just a few words about being pulled off
course. 
KIRK: Try and get me a fix on the Galileo. 
SULU: Scanners are blank, Captain. We're getting a mass of readings
I've never seen. Nothing makes sense. 
(Kirk switches on Spock's science computer) 
COMPUTER: Negative ionic concentration one point six four times ten to
the ninth power metres, Radiation wave length three hundred seventy
angstroms. Harmonics upward along entire spectrum. 
FERRIS: What is it, Captain? 
KIRK: That thing out there has ionized this complete sector. None of
our instruments work. At least four complete solar systems in the
immediate vicinity. And out there somewhere, a twenty four foot
shuttlecraft, off course, out of control. Finding a needle in a
haystack would be child's play. 
Captain's Log, stardate 2821.7. The electromagnetic
phenomenon known as Murasaki Three Twelve whirls like some angry blight
in space, a depressive reminder that seven shipmates still have not
been heard from. Equally bad, the effect has rendered our normal
searching systems useless. Without them, we are blind and almost
helpless. 
[Bridge]
(A Yeoman is delivering cups of coffee) 
FERRIS: I was opposed to this from the very beginning. Our flight to
Makus Three is of the very highest priority. 
KIRK: I'm aware of that, Commissioner. At the same time I have certain
scientific duties I must perform, and investigating the Murasaki effect
is one. 
FERRIS: Yes, but you've lost your crew. 
KIRK: We have two days to find them. 
FERRIS: Two days? ln all that? Two days? 
KIRK: What would you have me do, turn around and leave them there? 
FERRIS: You shouldn't have sent them out in the first place. Do you know what you've done? You've 
concerned yourself with only seven people. 
UHURA: Captain, there's one planet in this solar system capable of
sustaining human life. It's type M, oxygen, nitrogen, and it's listed
as Taurus Two. It's unexplored. As far as we can determine with our
equipment malfunction, it's just about dead-centre of the Murasaki
effect. 
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: Set course for Taurus Two. 
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. 
FERRIS: You said something about a needle in a haystack. It's useless. 
KIRK: If they're not there, Commissioner, then they're dead by now. 
[Shuttlecraft]
(Shuttlecraft Galileo appears to have landed in one
piece in a rocky landscape. It's contents have been rather shaken about
and many are holding their heads.) 
MCCOY: You all right? 
GAETANO: (Holding his right wrist) Yes. 
MCCOY: Scotty? Boma? 
BOMA: Now that's what I call a ride. 
MCCOY: Yeoman? 
MEARS: Yes. I just got a little bump on the head. 
MCCOY: (helping her back into her seat) Upsy-daisy. 
MEARS: Thank you. 
MCCOY: What happened? 
BOMA: I can't be sure, but I'd say that, the magnetic potential of the
effect was (McCoy gives him a tissue for his nose bleed) Thank you. Was
such that, as we gathered speed, it was multiplied geometrically. And
we were simply shot into the centre of the effect. Like a projectile. 
SPOCK: I'd say your evaluation is reasonable, Mister Boma. 
SCOTT: What a mess. 
SPOCK: Picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits, Mister
Scott. I think you'll find your work is cut out for you. Galileo to
Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. 
SCOTT: You don't really expect to get an answer, do you? 
SPOCK: I expect nothing, Mister Scott. It is merely logical to try all
the alternatives. Doctor McCoy, a reading on the atmosphere, please. 
MCCOY: Partial pressure of oxygen, seventy millimetres of mercury.
Nitrogen one forty. Breathable, if you're not running in competition. 
SPOCK: Just the facts, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Traces of argon, neon, krypton, all in acceptable quantities.
However, I wouldn't recommend this place as a summer resort. 
SPOCK: Thank you for your opinion. It will be duly noted. You're
recording this, Yeoman? 
MEARS: Of course, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, if you'll make a survey of the damage, please. 
SCOTT: Logical. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I think we should move outside, make room for Mister
Scott to do his work. Mister Latimer, Mister Gaetano, you'll arm
yourselves and scout out the area, keeping in visual contact with the
ship. 
LATIMER: Aye, aye, sir. 
(The two men go outside, and the doors close behind them) 
MCCOY: What do you think our chances are of contacting the Enterprise? 
SPOCK: Under present conditions, extremely poor. 
MCCOY: But they'll be looking for us. 
SPOCK: If the ionisation effect is as widespread as I believe it is,
Doctor, they'll be searching for us without instrumentation, by visual
contact only. On those terms, this is a very large planet. 
MCCOY: Then you don't think they'll find us. 
SPOCK: Not as long as we're grounded. We may be here for a very long
time, Doctor. 
[Bridge]
(Enterprise is orbiting a sickly green swirled
planet, and Commissioner Ferris is lounging by the door, watching Uhura
working.) 
UHURA: Nothing, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Yes, Captain? 
KIRK: Anything on your scanners? 
SULU: Totally inoperative, sir. No readings at all. 
KIRK: Have you tried tying in to the auxiliary power? 
SULU: Yes, sir. No change. 
KIRK: Transport room, this is the captain speaking. Are the
transporters beaming up yet? 
CHIEF [OC]: Not one hundred percent, Captain. We beamed down some inert
material, but it came back in a disassociated condition. We wouldn't
dare try with people. 
KIRK: Thank you. This is the captain speaking. Flight deck, prepare
Columbus for immediate exit, for a search of the planet surface.
Correlate co-ordinates with Mister Sulu. Thank you. Anything, Uhura? 
UHURA: All wavelengths dominated by ionisation effects, sir.
Transmission is blocked, reception impossible. 
FERRIS: Well, Captain? 
KIRK: We have until 2823.8 to continue the search, Commissioner. 
FERRIS: You don't really think you'll have any luck, do you? 
KIRK: Look, these people are my friends and my shipmates. I intend to
continue the ship's search for them until the last possible moment. 
FERRIS: Very well, Captain, but not one second beyond that moment. Is
that clear? If it isn't, I suggest you look at book nineteen, section
four thirty three, paragraph twelve. 
KIRK: I'm familiar with the regulations, Commissioner. I know all about
your authority. Launch shuttlecraft Columbus. 
[Outside the shuttlecraft]
(Spock is scanning one of it's small nacelles when
McCoy comes out to join him.) 
MCCOY: Well, I can't say much for the circumstances, but at least it's
your big chance. 
SPOCK: My big chance? For what, Doctor? 
MCCOY: Command. Oh, I know you, Mister Spock. You've never voiced it,
but you've always thought that logic was the best basis on which to
build command. Am I right? 
SPOCK: I am a logical man, Doctor. 
MCCOY: It'll take more than logic to get us out of this. 
SPOCK: Perhaps, Doctor, but I know of no better way to begin. I realise
command does have its fascinations, even under circumstances such as
these. But I neither enjoy the idea of command, nor am I frightened of
it. It simply exists. And I will do whatever logically needs to be
done.
Excuse me. 
(he heads back inside)
[Shuttlecraft]
SCOTT: Very bad, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: In what way? 
SCOTT: We've lost a great deal of fuel. We have no chance at all to
reach escape velocity. And if we ever hope to make orbit, we'll have to
lighten our load by at least five hundred pounds. 
SPOCK: The weight of three grown men. 
SCOTT: Aye, you could put it that way. 
MCCOY: Or the equivalent weight in equipment. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, with very few exceptions we use virtually every
piece of equipment aboard this craft in attaining orbit. There's very
little excess weight, except among the passengers. 
BOMA: You mean three of us must stay behind. 
SPOCK: Unless the situation changes radically, yes. 
BOMA: And who's to choose? 
SPOCK: As commanding officer, the choice will be mine. 
BOMA: You wouldn't be interested in drawing lots? 
SPOCK: A very quaint idea, Mister Boma, but I do believe I'm better
qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots. 
BOMA: All right, Mister Spock. Who? 
SPOCK: My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical
means. 
MCCOY: Mister Spock, life and death are seldom logical. 
SPOCK: But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor. Now gentlemen, I
suggest we move outside to make a further examination of the hull in
the event we've overlooked any minor damage. 
(Spock leaves) 
BOMA: If any minor damage was overlooked, it was when they put his head
together. 
MCCOY: Not his head, Mister Boma, his heart. His heart. 
[Rocky ledge]
(Latimer and Gaetano are investigating a strange
scraping sound, but the mist is obscuring their vision.) 
LATIMER: What is it? 
GAETANO: II don't know. It's from up there. 
LATIMER: No, it's from back there. 
GAETANO: It's everywhere. It's all around us! 
LATIMER: Let's get out of here. 
(They go to the top of the ridge, and Latimer stands up. Someone throws
a large flint-tipped spear into his back, and he falls. The scream is
heard back at the shuttlecraft) 
[Outside shuttlecraft]
SPOCK: Come on, Boma. 
[Bottom of the ledge]
(Gaetano fires his phaser at several different
enemies. The spear in Latimer's back is taller than a man) 
SPOCK: What was it? 
GAETANO: It was something huge, terrible. Up there. I think I hit it. 
BOMA: Did you see what it was? 
GAETANO: Vaguely. It was like a giant ape. 
BOMA: Poor Latimer. 
GAETANO: At least it was quick for him. 
BOMA: We'll get off all right. 
SPOCK: (returns from investigating) Nothing there. 
GAETANO: I tell you there was. 
SPOCK: I don't doubt your word. 
GAETANO: But there must be something. I swear I hit it. 
SPOCK: (pulling the bloody spear from Latimer's body and examining it)
Folsom Point. 
BOMA: Sir? 
SPOCK: There's a remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered
in 1925, old world calendar, New Mexico, North America. A bit more
crude about the shaft, I believe. Not very efficient. 
BOMA: Not very efficient? Is that all you have to say? 
SPOCK: Am I in error, Mister Boma? 
BOMA: You? Error? Impossible. 
SPOCK: Then what, Mister Boma? 
BOMA: There's a man lying there dead, and you talk about stone spears.
What about Latimer? 
SPOCK: My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life, Mister
Boma. 
GAETANO: Mister Spock. In the interest of efficiency, I don't think we
should leave his body here. 
SPOCK: Bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our
repair efforts. If you need assistance, I 
GAETANO: We'll do it. Give me a hand with Latimer, will you? 
Captain's Log, stardate 2822.3. We continue to
search, but I find it more difficult each moment to ward off a sense of
utter futility and great loss. 
[Bridge]
UHURA: Captain, the Columbus has returned from
searching quadrant seven seven nine X by five three four M. Results
negative. 
KIRK: Have them proceed to the next quadrant. Any word from engineering
on our sensors? 
UHURA: They're working on them, sir. Still inoperable. 
KIRK: What about the transporters? 
UHURA: They're still reported unsafe. 
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. 
FERRIS: Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, Commissioner? 
FERRIS: I don't relish the thought of abandoning your crewmen out
there, however I must remind you 
KIRK: I haven't forgotten, Commissioner. 
FERRIS: You're running out of time. 
KIRK: I haven't forgotten that, Commissioner. This is the captain. Try
using overload power on the transporters. We've got to get them
working. 
CHIEF [OC]: Aye, aye, Captain. 
KIRK: Uhura, order the Columbus to open its course two degrees on every
lap from now on. 
SULU: But Captain, two degrees means they'll be overlooking more than a
dozen terrestrial miles on each search loop. 
KIRK: It also means we have a fighting chance to cover the majority of
the planet's surface. Mind your helm, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Yes, sir. 
FERRIS: (stepping into the turbolift) Twenty four more hours, Captain. 
[Shuttlecraft]
SPOCK: Perhaps if you were to channel the second
auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve. 
SCOTT: It's too delicate. It may not be able to take the pressure as it
is. 
MCCOY: (coming in from rear compartment) This should save us at least
fifty pounds, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Excellent, Doctor. 
MEARS: We should be able to scrape up another hundred pounds. 
SPOCK: Which would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds
overweight. 
MCCOY: I can't believe you're serious about leaving someone behind. Now
whatever it is that's out there 
SPOCK: It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six, Doctor. 
MCCOY: I'm not talking about rationality. 
SPOCK: You might be wise to start. 
BOMA: (looking in from outside) Mister Spock. we're ready. 
SPOCK: For what? 
BOMA: The services for Latimer. 
SPOCK: Mister Boma, we're working against time. 
BOMA: The man's dead. He deserves a decent burial. You're the captain.
A few words. 
SPOCK: Doctor, perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion.
MCCOY: Mister Spock, that's your place. 
SPOCK: My place is here. If you please, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Now look. We may all die here. At least let us die like men, not
machines. 
SPOCK: By dealing with first things first, I hope to increase our
chances of staying alive. Well, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: If you'll give me a hand with this conduit. 
(Boma closes the door and leaves them to it) 
(later) 
SCOTT: Pressure's dropping. We're losing everything. 
SPOCK: What happened? 
SCOTT: One of the lines gave. The strain of coming through the
atmosphere and the added load when we tried to bypass. Yes, that's done
it.
We have no fuel. 
SPOCK: That would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind.
Consider the alternatives, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: We have no fuel! What alternatives? 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, there are always alternatives. 
MCCOY: Mister Spock! Something's happening outside. 
[Outside the shuttlecraft]
(They crouch down behind a rock while Spock stands
and listens to that scraping sound) 
MCCOY: What do those supersensitive ears make of that, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Wood rubbing on some kind of leather. 
GAETANO: They're getting ready. They'll attack. 
BOMA: Not necessarily. It could be a simple tribal rite, assuming a
tribal culture. 
SPOCK: Not a tribal culture. Their artefacts are too primitive. More
likely a loose association of some sort. 
MEARS: If we knew more about them 
BOMA: We know enough. If they're tribal, they'll have a sense of unity.
We can use that. 
SPOCK: How, Mister Boma? 
BOMA: By hitting them hard. Give them a bloody nose. Make them think
twice about attacking us. 
GAETANO: Yes, I agree. If we stand by and do nothing, we're just giving
them an invitation to come down and slaughter us. 
SPOCK: I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have for
life. 
GAETANO: Well, we're practical about it. I say we hit them before they
hit us. 
SPOCK: Mister Boma? 
BOMA: Absolutely. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy? 
MCCOY: Seems logical to me. 
SPOCK: It does, indeed. It seems logical to me, also. But to take life
indiscriminately, 
GAETANO: The majority. 
SPOCK: I am not interested in the opinion of the majority, Mister
Gaetano. Components must be weighed. Our danger to ourselves as well as
our duties to other life forms, friendly or not. There's a third
course. 
GAETANO: That could get us killed. 
SPOCK: I think not. Doctor McCoy. 
MCCOY: Yes. 
SPOCK: You and Yeoman Mears return to the ship. Assist Mister Scott in
any way possible. We'll be back shortly. 
MCCOY: Right. 
(Mears and McCoy leave) 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only
when so instructed, and at my designated targets. 
GAETANO: Now you're talking. 
SPOCK: We'll fire to frighten, Mister Gaetano, not to kill. 
GAETANO: Oh, for the. You saw what they did to Latimer! 
SPOCK: I am in command, Mister Gaetano. The orders and the
responsibility will be mine. Follow me. 
[Rocks]
(The trio are paddling through dry ice when a giant
spear is thrown across their path. Spock fires at one assailant, who
throws his shield at them too. They move on a little way.) 
BOMA: The mists. I can't see them. 
SPOCK: I hear them. They're directly ahead of us. Several, I believe.
Direct your phasers to two o'clock and to ten o'clock. 
GAETANO: I say we hit them dead on. 
SPOCK: Yes, I know. But fortunately, I'm giving the orders. Take aim
please, and fire when I give a signal. 
(He climbs partway up a rock, for a better view.) 
SPOCK: Fire. (several seconds of sustained phaser beam) Cease fire.
(It's gone quiet) They should think twice before bothering us again. 
GAETANO: I still say we should have killed them. 
SPOCK: It was not necessary. Fear will do for us what needs to be done.
Mister Boma, you will return with me to the Galileo. Mister Gaetano,
you remain on guard here. Keep in contact with the ship. 
(Boma says a silent goodbye to his colleague, and the noise starts up
again)
[Shuttlecraft]
MEARS: Did you find them? 
SPOCK: Yes, we found them. They won't bother us again. 
MCCOY: I hope not. Scotty has an idea. 
SCOTT: It's dangerous, but it might work. 
SPOCK: Go, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: I can adjust the main reactor to function with a substitute fuel
supply. 
SPOCK: That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply. 
SCOTT: Aye, we do. Our phasers. I can adapt them and use their energy.
It'll take time, but it's possible. 
MCCOY: Trouble is, they happen to be our only defence. 
SPOCK: They would also seem to be our only hope. 
SCOTT: Aye. 
SPOCK: (after brief thought) Yeoman, your phaser. 
MEARS: But what if the creatures attack again? 
SPOCK: They won't attack for at least several hours. By then, with
luck, we'll be gone. 
SCOTT: If I can get a full load, we should be able to achieve orbit
with all hands. Not that we can maintain it long. 
SPOCK: We don't have to maintain it very long, Mister Scott. In less
than twenty four hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its
search in order to make a rendezvous. If we can't maintain orbit after
that time, it won't make any difference. If we burn up in a decaying
orbit or die here on the planet's surface, we shall surely die. Doctor,
your phaser. Go to work, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: Aye, aye, sir. 
[Transporter room]
(A bunch of boxes is beamed aboard) 
CHIEF: They came back all right, sir. In my opinion, the transporters
are now safe for human transport. 
KIRK: Good. This is the captain. Landing parties one, two, and three,
report to transporter room for immediate beaming down to surface of the
planet. Ordinance condition One A. 
CHIEF: Captain, it's a big planet. It'll be sheer luck if our landing
parties find anything. 
KIRK: I'm depending on luck, Lieutenant. It's almost the only tool we
have that'll work. 
[Rocks]
(Gaetano has worked himself up into a panic when a
rock knocks his phaser out of his hand. Then a spear is thrown, and
finally the giant creature comes for the helpless man)
(Spock, Boma and McCoy arrive on the scene a little later, and examine
the marks in the ground. Spock picks up the dropped phaser) 
SPOCK: Take this back to Mister Scott for conversion, please Doctor. 
BOMA: Nobody knows what's happened to Gaetano, and you hand over his
phaser like
nothing's happened at all. 
SPOCK: (handing over his own phaser) And give this to Mister Scott in
the event I don't return. 
MCCOY: Just where are you going? 
SPOCK: I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of
Mister Gaetano. Return to the ship, please. 
(Spock leaves) 
MCCOY: I don't know. He'll risk his neck locating Gaetano and if he
finds him, he's just as liable to order him to stay behind. You tell
me. 
BOMA: Do you really think the ship will ever leave? 
MCCOY: Well, it won't unless we get these phasers back. 
(Further on, Spock finds Gaetano's body draped over a rock. He picks
him up in a fireman's lift and heads back to the shuttlecraft with him.
Spears are thrown. McCoy and Boma help him get the body inside.)
[Shuttlecraft]
(Scott is still lying in the middle of the floor,
working) 
MCCOY: Well, Mister Spock, they didn't stay frightened very long, did
they? 
SPOCK: Most illogical reaction. We demonstrated our superior weapons.
They should have fled. 
MCCOY: You mean they should have respected us? 
SPOCK: Of course. 
MCCOY: Mister Spock, respect is a rational process. Did it ever occur
to you they might react emotionally, with anger? 
SPOCK: Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability. 
MCCOY: They were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling. You
might as well admit it, Mister Spock, your precious logic brought them
down on us. 
MEARS: Why haven't they done anything? 
SPOCK: They're studying us, for the moment. 
BOMA: Another prediction, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: My opinion, Mister Boma. 
(The shuttlecraft shakes as one of the locals starts battering it with
a rock) 
SPOCK: Seal the windows! 
MCCOY: Studying us, Mister Spock? They seem to learn rather quickly. 
BOMA: All right, Spock, you have all the answers. What now? 
SPOCK: Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile. 
BOMA: My tone isn't the only thing that's hostile, Mister Spock! 
SPOCK: Curious. Most illogical. 
BOMA: I'm sick and tired of your logic! 
MEARS: We could use a little inspiration. 
SPOCK: Strange. Step by step, I have made the correct and logical
decisions. And yet two men have died. 
MCCOY: And you've brought our furry friends down on us. 
SPOCK: I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated
resentment on your parts. The sum of the parts cannot be greater than
the whole. 
MCCOY A little less analysis and more action. That's what we need,
Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: How much longer, Mister Scott? 
SCOTT: Another hour, maybe two. 
MCCOY: That won't be long enough. 
SCOTT: Doctor, a phaser can only drain so fast. 
BOMA: How long do you think those plates will hold out under this?
We've got to do something! 
SCOTT: You've got your hands full. 
Captain's Log, stardate 2823.1. Our landing parties
are on the surface of Taurus Two. We continue to hope. Instruments are
slowly returning to an operable condition as the ion storm slowly
disperses. On the ship, we can only wait helplessly. 
[Bridge]
KIRK: What word from the sensor section? 
UHURA: At last report they were getting some readings 
KIRK: I'm not interested in the last report. I want to know now. 
UHURA: Yes, sir. 
FERRIS: You have two hours and forty three minutes, Captain. 
KIRK: I'm perfectly aware of how much time I have left. 
FERRIS: I'm delighted. However I shall continue to remind you. 
KIRK: You do that. 
UHURA: Sir, sensor section reporting. Static interference still
creating false images. Estimates eighty percent undependable. 
KIRK: What about radio communication? 
UHURA: Clearing slowly. Still incapable of transmission or reception. 
FERRIS: What do you intend to do? 
KIRK: Do? I intend to continue the search. Foot by foot, inch by inch,
by candlelight if necessary, until the last possible moment. And if
you'd keep your nose off my bridge, I'd be thankful. 
FERRIS: I'm sure the authorities will be pleased by your diligence,
Captain. I'm not sure they'll appreciate the way you address a High
Commissioner. 
KIRK: I'm in command here, Mister Ferris. 
FERRIS: You are, Captain. For another two hours and forty two minutes. 
[Shuttlecraft]
SPOCK: Mister Scott, how much power do we have left
in the ship's batteries? 
SCOTT: They're in good shape, but they won't lift us off, if that's
what you're getting at. 
SPOCK: Will they electrify the exterior of this ship? 
SCOTT: That they will, Mister Spock! 
(He dashes to the rear compartment and puts on big rubber gloves) 
SPOCK: Get to the centre of the ship. Don't touch the plates. Be sure
you're insulated. Stand by. Are you ready, Scott? 
SCOTT: Ready, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: All right. Go. (Scott uses a spanner or something to short out
the battery connections) Again! Again! 
(It goes quiet and still outside) 
SCOTT: I daren't use any more. Not and be sure of ignition. 
SPOCK: I believe we've used enough. Mister Scott. I suggest you
continue draining the phasers. 
SCOTT: Aye. 
MCCOY: It must've worked. 
SPOCK: For the moment. 
BOMA: For the moment? 
SPOCK: The moment they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be
back. Meanwhile, please check the aft compartment. See if there's
anything you can unload to lighten the ship. 
BOMA: Mister Gaetano's body's back there. 
SPOCK: It will of course have to be left behind. 
BOMA: Not without a burial. 
SPOCK: I wouldn't recommend it. The creatures won't be far away. 
BOMA: Not without a burial, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: It would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril. 
BOMA: I'll take that chance. You see, Mister Spock, I would insist upon
a decent burial even if your body was back there. 
MCCOY: Mister Boma. 
BOMA: I'm sick and tired of this machine! 
SCOTT: That's enough! 
SPOCK: Gentlemen. All right, Mister Boma, you'll have your burial,
provided the creatures will permit it. 
[Bridge]
UHURA: Captain Kirk, landing party number two has
been beamed back aboard ship. They have casualties. One dead, two
injured. 
KIRK: (going to Spock's station) Put Lieutenant Kelowitz on visual. 
KELOWITZ [on monitor]: Kelowitz, Captain. 
(His uniform is dirty and he sounds tired) 
KIRK: Report. 
KELOWITZ [on monitor]: We were attacked, Captain. Huge, furry
creatures. I checked with astral anthropology, and they're order 480G,
anthropoid. Similar to life forms discovered on Hansen's Planet, but
much larger. Ten, twelve feet in height. 
KIRK: There are casualties? 
KELOWITZ [on monitor]: Ensign O'Neal got a spear through the body
before we even knew they were around. Lieutenant lmmamura has a
dislocated shoulder and severe lacerations, but he'll make it all
right. Captain, the creatures are all over the place. If the Galileo is
down on that planet, I 
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. You'd better report to Sickbay yourself. 
KELOWITZ [on monitor]: Aye, aye, Captain. 
(Commissioner Ferris enters) 
FERRIS: Captain Kirk, check your chronometer. You'll see that it is
2823.8. Your time is up. 
KIRK: But they're still out there. 
FERRIS: So are the plague victims on New Paris. I'm sorry, Captain. I
now assume authority granted me under Title fifteen, Galactic Emergency
Procedures, and I order you to abandon search. 
KIRK: The Columbus hasn't returned yet. I still have two search parties
out. 
FERRIS: You're procrastinating, Captain. You have your orders. Recall
your search parties and proceed to Makus Three immediately. 
KIRK: Lieutenant. 
UHURA: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: Order the transporter room to immediately beam up the two search
parties from the surface. Attempt to contact the Columbus. 
UHURA: I'm in partial contact with them now, sir. 
KIRK: Then have them return immediately. Mister Sulu, prepare to
abandon search. Set course for Makus Three. 
Captain's log, supplement. The search parties have
returned to the ship, and the Columbus is on its way back. I have been
compelled to abandon the search. 
[Bridge]
UHURA: Captain, the sensor section says the beams
are working again. 
KIRK: What about the other systems? 
UHURA: No, sir. Too much interference. 
SULU: Captain, course set for Makus Three. 
KIRK: Stand ready, Mister Sulu. How long before the Columbus comes on
board? 
UHURA: Twenty three minutes, sir. 
KIRK: Twenty three minutes. 
[Shuttlecraft]
MEARS: Enterprise, this is Galileo. Come in,
please. Enterprise. Nothing, sir. Just ionic interference. 
SCOTT: That's it. 
SPOCK: How about weight? 
SCOTT: If we shed every ounce, we might be able to achieve orbit. 
SPOCK: And how long can we hold it? 
SCOTT: A few hours, no longer. But if we time it right, we can cut out
of orbit and save enough fuel for a controlled re=entry. 
SPOCK: To land here again? Not a very attractive possibility. 
SCOTT: We have very few alternatives, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy. Mister Boma. When can we lift off, Scott? 
SCOTT: Maybe eight minutes if the weight's right. 
(McCoy appears from the aft compartment) 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes. You
have that long to bury Mister Gaetano. Now, it appears to be clear
outside, at least for the moment. I'll assist you. Hurry. 
[Bridge]
UHURA: The Columbus is aboard, sir. The flight
hatch is closed. Transporter room reports
last of the landing parties have beamed safely up. All systems report
secured for warp factors. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, proceed on course for Makus Three, at space normal
speed. 
SULU: Space normal, sir? 
KIRK: Those are my orders. Lieutenant Uhura, order all sensor sections
to direct beams aft. Full function, continuous operation until further
orders. 
UHURA: Yes, sir. 
{Shuttlecraft]
(From our viewpoint inside, we see the three men
standing by two mounds of soil when giant spears start landing near
them) 
SPOCK: Get into the ship! Immediate lift off! 
(He throws a spear back, then gets pinned against a rock outcrop by a
thrown boulder) 
SPOCK: No! Go back! Lift off! Go back! No! 
(But Boma and McCoy ignore his orders and free him) 
SPOCK: All right, All right! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
(They all get safely into the shuttlecraft) 
SPOCK: Go, Scott! 
SCOTT: Aye, aye, sir. 
SPOCK: I told you to lift off! 
MCCOY: Don't be a fool, Mister Spock. We couldn't leave you out there. 
SPOCK: Get us off, Scott! 
SCOTT: We should be moving, but we're not. 
SPOCK: Quite right, Mister Scott. There's somebody holding us down. All
systems are go, but we're not moving. 
(Throws switches on the pilot's panel) 
SCOTT: What are you doing? 
SPOCK: Our boosters. 
SCOTT: We'll never be able to hold orbit. 
SPOCK: Would you rather stay here? 
SCOTT: No, Mister Spock. 
(They swap seats) 
MEARS: We're moving! 
BOMA: They let go! 
MCCOY: We got off! 
SPOCK: May I remind you we have yet to achieve orbit, nor can we
maintain it long. An hour from now we may be right back where we
started from. 
(The Galileo leaves the sickly yellow and green atmosphere of the
planet) 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, by coming after me, you may well have destroyed what
slim chance you had for survival. The logical thing for you to have
done was to have left me behind. 
MCCOY: Mister Spock, remind me to tell you that I'm sick and tired of
your logic. 
SPOCK: That is a most illogical attitude. Orbit in one minute, Mister
Scott. Fuel status? 
SCOTT: Fifteen pounds psi. Approximately enough for one orbit, sir. 
MCCOY: After that? 
SCOTT: Tapping our boosters ended our last chance for a soft landing. 
BOMA: You mean a burn-up? 
SPOCK: It is the usual end of a decaying orbit. 
MEARS: I don't want to die up here. 
SPOCK: Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd be granted on
the planet's surface, I should think. 
BOMA: I admire your ability to make so measured a choice. 
SCOTT: Mister Spock, you said a while ago that there were always
alternatives. 
SPOCK: Did l? I may have been mistaken. 
MCCOY: Well, at least I lived long enough to hear that. Is there
anything we can do? 
SPOCK: The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus Three by now. I for
one do not believe in angels. 
MCCOY: Well, Mister Spock, so ends your first command. 
SPOCK: Yes. My first command. 
SCOTT: Orbit attitude, Mister Spock. With our present fuel, that gives
us about forty five minutes. 
SPOCK: Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please.
Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. 
(He ponders for a moment, then flicks the Fuel Jettison button) 
SCOTT: Mister Spock! 
(There's a jolt as two long plumes of flame streak out from the
nacelles) 
MEARS: What happened? 
SCOTT: He jettisoned the fuel and ignited it. 
BOMA: We need that fuel to maintain orbit. Are you out of your mind? 
SPOCK: Perhaps, Mister Boma. 
MCCOY: How long have we got now, Scotty? 
SCOTT: The orbit'll start decaying as soon as the fuel's exhausted. Say
six minutes. 
[Bridge]
(The air is full of pointless status reports over
the comm. when suddenly) 
SULU: Captain, there's something there on screen, at Taurus Two. 
(On the viewscreen, a long trail of yellow crosses the green of the
planet) 
KIRK: Sensors, a meteorite? 
SULU: No. It's holding a lateral line. There it is again. Holding
steady, Captain. 
KIRK: A hundred and eighty degrees about, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant
Uhura, contact transporter room. All beams ready. Full normal speed. 
[Shuttlecraft]
SCOTT: A distress signal? It's like sending up a
flare. Mister Spock, that was a good gamble. Perhaps it was worth it. 
SPOCK: No one out there to see it. 
(The plume of flame fades out) 
SCOTT: Orbit decaying, Mister Spock. Ten seconds to atmosphere. 
MCCOY: It may be the last action you'll ever take, Mister Spock, but it
was all human. 
SPOCK: Totally illogical. There was no chance. 
MCCOY: That's exactly what I mean. 
(The front of the little craft starts to glow red, and instrumentation
begins to smoke and crackle.) 
MEARS: It's getting hot. 
[Bridge]
UHURA: Transporters locked in, sir. 
KIRK: Activate beams. 
(Our last view inside Galileo is of lots of smoke, then transporter
beams) 
SULU: Whatever it was, Captain, it just burned up in the atmosphere. 
UHURA: Captain, transporter room just beamed up five persons. Alive and
well. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, proceed on course to Makus Three. Ahead warp factor
one. 
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. Warp factor one. 
(later, everyone is back on duty) 
KIRK: Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
KIRK: There's really something I don't understand about all of this.
Maybe you can explain it to me. Logically, of course.
When you jettisoned the fuel and ignited it, you knew there was
virtually no chance of it being seen, yet you did it anyhow. That would
seem to me to be an act of desperation. 
SPOCK: Quite correct, Captain. 
KIRK: Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor will agree with me, that
desperation is a highly emotional state of mind. How does your
well-known logic explain that? 
SPOCK: Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles,
and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the
circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of
desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at. 
KIRK: I see. You mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional
outburst. 
SPOCK: Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but
those are essentially the facts. 
KIRK: You're not going to admit that for the first time in your life,
you committed a purely human emotional act? 
SPOCK: No, sir. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, you're a stubborn man. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir.

Squire of Gothos
Stardate:
2124.5
Original Airdate: 12 Jan, 1967
  [Bridge]
 (A Yeoman is distributing coffees when McCoy
enters) 
DESALLE: All clear ahead, Captain. The sensors indicate zero register. 
KIRK: Forward readings, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Gravimetric readings, no significant change, zero space density.
KIRK: Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu. Colony Beta Six wants their
supplies. Let's get across this void in a hurry. 
MCCOY: Void, star desert. The word conjures up pictures of dunes,
oases, mirages. 
KIRK: Sunlight, palm trees. We're nine hundred light years from that
kind of desert, Bones. 
SPOCK: The precise meaning of the word desert is a waterless, barren
wasteland. I fail to understand your romantic nostalgia for such a
place. 
MCCOY: That doesn't surprise me, Mister Spock. I can't imagine a mirage
ever disturbing those mathematically perfect brain waves of yours. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Moving on schedule into quadrant nine
oh four. Beta Six is eight days distant. 
KIRK: Something, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Unusual, Captain. I'm now getting a sizable space-displacement
reading. 
KIRK: Can you verify that, Navigator? 
DESALLE: No, sir. Forward sweeps are negative. Wait. Verified, sir. We
must be in some sort of light warp or we'd have picked it up earlier. 
KIRK: Put it on visual. 
(A purple globe appears on the viewscreen) 
DESALLE: Iron-silica body, planet sized, magnitude one E. We'll be
passing close. 
SPOCK: Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on all our records. 
KIRK: And yet, here it is. No time to investigate. Science stations,
gather data for computer banks. Uhura, notify the discovery on subspace
radio. 
UHURA: Strong interference on subspace, Captain. The planet must be a
natural radio source. 
KIRK: Let's get out of its range. Veer forty degrees to starboard,
Mister Sulu. 
SULU: Forty degrees. 
(He reaches for the switch, and sways as if dizzy, then stands up and
vanishes) 
KIRK: Sulu! 
(He dashes to Sulu's station, then suddenly stops and disappears too) 
DESALLE: Mister Spock, they're gone! 
SPOCK: Emergency! Full reverse power!
Ship's log Stardate 2124.5. First Officer Spock
reporting for Captain James Kirk. We are orbiting the lone unrecorded
planet in the star desert. For four hours, we have made every possible
instrument sweep, but Captain Kirk and Helmsman Sulu remain unaccounted
for. I have placed the ship on red alert.
[Bridge]
(Enterprise is now orbiting a red planet with white
whispy clouds) 
SCOTT: We've searched again from stem to stern. If they're not down on
that planet, they're nowhere. 
DESALLE: No sign of human life on the surface, sir. Unless the
instruments aren't functioning. 
SPOCK: Function is normal. Continuous sensor sweeps. Lieutenant Uhura,
have you checked all wave bands? 
UHURA: All of them, Mister Spock. No response. 
DESALLE: With due respect, sir. Request permission to transport to the
surface immediately and carry out a search. 
MCCOY: I second DeSalle's request. What are we waiting for? 
SPOCK: The decision will be mine, Doctor. I have the responsibility for
your safety. (to Sulu's replacement) Mister Jaeger, describe your
geophysical findings for the surface below. 
JAEGER: No detectable soil or vegetation. Extremely hot, toxic
atmosphere swept by tornadic storm. Continuous volcanic eruptions.
Deadly to any lifeforms such as we know it without oxygen and
life-support systems. 
SPOCK: Estimate survival time of two unprotected individuals down
there. 
JAEGER: Not very long. 
UHURA: Mister Spock. Look. 
(Words are appearing on the monitor above her head, in gothic script.
Spock reads them out loud) 
SPOCK: Greetings and felicitations. Hmm. Send this, Lieutenant. USS
Enterprise to signaler on planet surface. Identify self. 
(The reply comes up on the monitor) 
SPOCK: Hip hip hoorah? And I believe it's pronounced tally ho. 
DESALLE: Some kind of a joke, sir? 
SPOCK: I'll entertain any theories, Mister DeSalle. Any at all. 
MCCOY: One thing is certain. Obviously there's life on that planet. 
SPOCK: You're quite correct, Doctor. Prepare transporter room. 
SCOTT: Request assignment to the search party, sir. 
SPOCK: No, Mister Scott. Neither you nor I can be spared here. Mister
DeSalle, equip the landing party with full communications, armament,
and life-support gear. Mister Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge may be
crucial down there. Doctor McCoy will accompany. If those peculiar
signals are coming from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their
rationality is in question. Dismissed. 
[Transporter room]
UHURA [OC]: No more messages from below, sir, but
I've locked onto their original source. 
SPOCK: Very good. Transmit coordinates to Mister Scott. Once on the
planet's surface, you'll establish contact with us immediately. Use the
laser beacon if necessary. Ready, Scott? 
SCOTT: Ready, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Activate. 
[Planet surface]
(The landing party arrive on grass, amidst trees
and shrubs. Jaeger starts scanning immediately.) 
MCCOY: Where are your storms, Jaeger? 
JAEGER: Atmosphere exactly the same as ours. 
(He takes of his oxygen mask, sniffs, and signals that the other two
can do the same.) 
DESALLE: DeSalle to Enterprise. DeSalle to Enterprise. It doesn't
function. We're cut off. 
MCCOY: (trying his own communicator) No response. 
DESALLE: (to Jaeger) Keep trying with yours. Something's blocking the
beacon. I've got to find open ground. 
(He wanders off through the shrubs) 
DESALLE: Mister Jaeger! McCoy! 
(They join him to see a stone building in the gothic style, with an
iron-bound oak door. They approach cautiously, and enter) 
[Drawing Room]
(The place is stuffed full of things. A bust of
Napoleon on a stand, a suit of armour, a globe, tapestry and swords and
shields on the walls, an open fire, a harpsichord and a large mirror) 
MCCOY: In the name of heaven, where are we? 
(They head down steps into the room, past the Salt Monster in an
alcove) 
DESALLE: Look. 
(Sulu and Kirk are displayed in a mini-minstrel's gallery. McCoy scans
them.) 
MCCOY: There's no reading. They're like waxworks figures. 
(The main door slams shut, and there's a man in an embroidered coat
playing the harpsichord) 
TRELANE: I must say, they make a perfectly exquisite display pair, but
I suppose you want them back now. 
(He waves his hand and the two men come back to life) 
SULU: Where are we? 
TRELANE: Welcome to an island of peace on my stormy little planet of
Gothos. 
KIRK: What happened? Fill me in. 
MCCOY: You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu. We've been looking
for you for four hours. 
TRELANE: You must excuse my whimsical way of fetching you here, but
when I saw you passing by I simply could not resist. 
KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship Enterprise. 
TRELANE: Ah, so you're the Captain of these brave lads. My greetings
and felicitations, Captain. So good of you and your officers to drop
in.
Absolutely smashing. 
KIRK: Who are you? Where do you come from? 
General Trelane, retired. At your service, sirs. My home is your home. 
(He goes back to his playing) 
DESALLE: We've lost contact with the ship, Captain. We're trapped here.
TRELANE: I can't tell you how delighted I am to have visitors from the
very planet that I've made my hobby. Yes, but according to my
observations, I didn't think you capable of such voyages. 
JAEGER: Notice the period, Captain. Nine hundred light years from
Earth. It's what might be seen through a viewing scope if it were
powerful enough. 
TRELANE: Ah, yes. I've been looking in on the doings on your lively
little Earth. 
KIRK: Then you've been looking in on the doings nine hundred years
past. 
TRELANE: Oh, really? Have I made an error in time? How fallible of me.
Oh, I did so want to make you feel at home. I'm quite proud of the
detail. 
KIRK: General Trelane. 
TRELANE: Retired, sir. Just Squire Trelane now. And you may call me
Squire. Yes, I rather fancy that. 
KIRK: For what purpose have you imprisoned us here? 
TRELANE: Imprisoned? Nonsense. You're my guests. You see, I just
finished my studies of your curious and fascinating society. You came
by at the most propitious moment. I want to know all about your
campaigns, your battles, your missions of conquest. 
KIRK: Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest. When we do battle,
it is only because we have no choice. 
TRELANE: Ah, but that's the official story, eh? 
KIRK: I must ask you to let us go back to our ship. 
TRELANE: I wouldn't hear of it. You shall join me in a repast. I want
to learn all about your feelings on war and killing and conquest. That
sort of thing. Do you know that you're one of the few predator species
that preys even on itself? 
(Kirk returns to the main group, where DeSalle has his hand on his
phaser) 
KIRK: Not yet. Put it on stun, not to kill, DeSalle. 
TRELANE: DeSalle, did you say? Un vrai Francais? 
DESALLE: My ancestry is French, yes. 
TRELANE: Ah, monsieur. Vive la gloire. Vive Napoleon. You know, I
admire your Napoleon very much. 
KIRK: This is Mister DeSalle, our navigator. Doctor McCoy, our medical
officer. Mister Sulu, our helmsman, and Carl Jaeger, meteorologist. 
TRELANE: Welcome, good physicianer and honourable sir. (bows low) 
SULU: Is he kidding? 
TRELANE: Und Offizier Jaeger, und der deutsche Soldat, nein? (gives a
little Prussian salute then marches around) Eins, zwei, drei, vier.
Gehen vir mit dem Schiessgewehr. 
JAEGER: I'm a scientist, not a military man. 
TRELANE: Oh come now. We're all military men under the skin. And how we
do love our uniforms. 
(Trelane is admiring himself in his mirror when he spots DeSalle
raising his weapon, and with a wave of the hand, stops him)
TRELANE: What an interesting weapon you've got there. Do let me see it.
(He takes it out of DeSalle's hand, and he can move again) 
TRELANE:: Yes. Now let me see. How does this work? Ah, yes. This won't
kill, and this will. 
(He fires it at the Salt Monster, who is disintegrated) 
TRELANE: Oh, how marvellous! (destroys another exhibit) Devastating!
Why, this could kill millions. 
(Kirk takes it off him) 
KIRK: Who will you start with, my crew? Are we your next targets? 
TRELANE: Oh, how absolutely typical of your species. You don't
understand something, so you become fearful. Now, do let me anticipate
your next question. You want to know how I've managed all of this. 
KIRK: That's correct. 
TRELANE: We, meaning I and others, have, to state the matter briefly,
perfected a system by which matter can be transferred to energy and
back to matter again. 
KIRK: Like the transporter system aboard the Enterprise. 
TRELANE: Oh, a crude example of an infinitely more sophisticated
process. You see, we not only transport matter from place to place, but
we can alter its shape at will. 
KIRK: This drawing room, did you create it by rearranging matter on
this planet? 
TRELANE: Quite. 
KIRK: I see. How did you manage 
TRELANE: Dear Captain, your inquiries are becoming tiresome. I want you
to be happy. Free yourself of care. Let's enjoy ourselves in the spirit
of martial good fellowship. 
KIRK: Come on, let's go. We're getting out of here. 
TRELANE: Tut, tut, tut. You're being quite rude. You can't go.
Apparently, you need another demonstration of my authority. Yes, quite.
(Kirk vanishes from the room and is in the natural atmosphere of the
planet, choking on the fumes. Everyone in the room can hear him.
Trelane brings him back) Now, that's a sample of the atmosphere of this
planet outside my kindly influence. Now, you will behave yourself
hereafter, won't you? Or I shall be very, very angry.
Captain's Log Stardate 2125.7. Science Officer
Spock reporting for Captain Kirk. We have completed fourteenth orbit of
this planet without establishing contact with our missing officers or
the parties sent to find them. Subspace communications remain blocked.
However, by diverting impulse power to our sensors, we have made them
operable, and we have detected one small area on the surface
which seems relatively stable. 
[Bridge]
SCOTT: Aye, it's there, Mister Spock. Peaceful as
Earth, but how do you explain it? 
SPOCK: I don't, Mister Scott. It simply exists. Artificial perhaps, or
a freak of nature. The fact remains that life can exist in that area. 
SCOTT: Aye, it could, but it couldn't move around much. 
SPOCK: Apply a fine tuning on our sensors. Locate any life forms in
that stable area. 
SCOTT: If we find any, it doesn't follow that it would be our people. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. But if the Captain is down there and alive, that's
where he'll have to be. We'll attempt to transport up any living beings
our sensors detect. 
SCOTT: Shooting in the dark, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Or stand by and do nothing, Mister Scott. 
[Drawing Room]
(Trelane is showing off his decor) 
And this, of course, is an array of your battle flags and pennants
dating back to the Crusades, to Hannibal's invaders, the Grecian war
galleys, and the hordes of Persia. Can't you imagine it, Captain? The
thousands of men marching off to their deaths, singing beneath these
banners. Doesn't it make your blood run swiftly? 
(Then he goes back to his music) 
SULU: Captain, where could he possibly come from? Who is this maniac? 
MCCOY: Better say, what is he? I monitored him, and what I found was
unbelievable. 
KIRK: Not alive? 
MCCOY: Not in the way we define life. No trace. Zero. 
SULU: You mean, it shows he's dead? 
MCCOY: It doesn't even show that he exists at all, alive or dead. 
JAEGER: Notice the wood fire, Captain? Burning steadily, ember bed
glowing, and it doesn't give off any heat at all. 
KIRK: Fire without heat, mistaking all this for present day Earth
without taking into account the time differential. Whatever we're
dealing with,
he certainly isn't all knowledgeable. He makes mistakes. 
TRELANE: Discussing deep laid plans, I'll wager. I cannot wait to see
them evolve. 
KIRK: Trelane, we haven't planned 
TRELANE: Tut tut. Do not think that I deplore your martial virtue of
deception and stratagem. Quite the contrary. I have nothing but
admiration for your whole species. 
KIRK: If your admiration is genuine, you must have respect for our
sense of duty too. Our ship has need of us. We have tasks to perform. 
TRELANE: Oh, I can't let you go now. I was getting a bit bored until
you came. You must stay. I insist. 
KIRK: For how long? 
TRELANE: Until this is over, of course. 
KIRK: Until what is over? 
TRELANE: Dear Captain, so many questions. Make the most of an uncertain
future. Enjoy yourself today. Tomorrow may never come at all. 
KIRK: Trelane, even if we wanted to stay, our companions are missing
us. 
TRELANE: Yes, I must experience your sense of concern, your grief at
the separation. 
KIRK: There are four hundred men and women aboard that ship. 
TRELANE: Women? Do you mean that you actually have members of the
fairer sex among your crew? Oh, how charming. And they must be all very
beautiful. And I shall be so very gallant to them. Here, let me fetch
them down at once. 
KIRK: (grabbing his arm) No. 
TRELANE: No? 
KIRK: This game has gone on long enough. Those are crucial operating
personnel. You can't 
TRELANE: I can do anything I want. I should think you would have
realised that by now. 
MCCOY: Captain, receiving a transporter signal. 
TRELANE: Transporter signal? What does he mean? You must tell me! 
KIRK: It means, Trelane, the party's over, thanks to Mister Spock. 
TRELANE: (as the group is beamed away) Wait! I won't have this! I
haven't dismissed you yet. Stop! I won't have this! 
[Transporter room]
KIRK: Everyone to stations. Report, Mister Spock.
How were our scanners able to penetrate that radiation field? 
SPOCK: They didn't, Captain. Not clearly. We merely beamed up all life
forms in a given area. 
MCCOY: Which means Trelane is not a life form as we know it, or he'd be
beaming through now. 
KIRK: Prepare to warp out of here at once. Maximum speed. 
[Bridge]
ROSS: (a blonde yeoman) Oh, Captain, I was so
worried. 
KIRK: Scotty, we're going to need every ounce of your engines. We're
going to put a hundred million miles between us and that madman. 
SCOTT [OC]: Aye aye, sir. 
MCCOY: I'm quaking, but I don't know if it's from laughter or terror. 
UHURA: Doctor, what was it? What was down there? 
MCCOY: Well, it was a. Oh, forget it. 
ROSS: Look. 
(Trelane has appeared on the Bridge) 
TRELANE: Where are all your weapons, Captain? Don't you display your
weapons? 
KIRK: Trelane. 
TRELANE: Don't fret, Captain. I'm only a bit upset with you, but this
Mister Spock you mentioned, the one responsible for that unseemly,
impudent act of taking you from me, which is he? 
SPOCK: I am Spock. 
TRELANE: Surely not an officer. He isn't quite human, is he? 
SPOCK: My father is from the planet Vulcan. 
TRELANE: And are its natives predatory? 
SPOCK: Not generally. But there have been exceptions. 
TRELANE: Really? You will see to his punishment? 
KIRK: On the contrary. I commend his action. 
TRELANE: But I don't like him. 
KIRK: Get off my ship. 
TRELANE: Oh, rot! You're all going back with me. 
KIRK: We're not going anywhere. 
TRELANE: Nonsense. I have an absolutely enchanting sojourn on Gothos
planned for all of you, and you shan't spoil it for me. Anyway, the
decor of my drawing room is much more appropriate 
[Drawing Room]
(A lot of the clutter in the middle of the room has
been replaced by a fully furnished dining table and six high-backed
chairs. Sulu and DeSalle are already seated)
TRELANE: And tasteful. Don't you agree? 
SULU: No. 
TRELANE: But so much more fitting, honourable sir. 
DESALLE: (getting up) You 
KIRK: DeSalle. 
(Trelane 'stops' him) 
TRELANE: Oh, what primitive fury. Why, he's the very soul of sublime
savagery. 
KIRK: Trelane, let him go. 
(he does, and Sulu grabs DeSalle) 
SULU: We haven't even got our phasers. 
TRELANE: Yes, of course. I forget that I shouldn't frighten you too
much. But I warn you, you can't provoke me again. Come, everyone. Let's
forget your bad manners. Let's be full of merry talk and sallies of
wit. We have victuals to delight the palate and brave company to
delight the mind. Come, Doctor, do partake. Ah, you've been quite
derelict in your social duties, Captain. You haven't introduced me to
the charming contingent of your crew. 
KIRK: This is General Trelane. 
TRELANE: Retired. But if you prefer, you may address me as the lonely
Squire of Gothos, dear ladies. 
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura of communications. 
TRELANE: Ah a Nubian prize. (he kisses her hand) Taken on one of your
raids of conquest, no doubt, Captain. 
KIRK: No doubt. 
TRELANE: She has the melting eyes of the queen of Sheba. The same
lovely colouring. And this. Is this the face that launched a thousand
ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Fair Helen, make me
immortal with a kiss. 
KIRK: (holding Trelane back) Yeoman Teresa Ross. I believe you have met
our science officer Mister Spock. 
TRELANE: You do realise, don't you, that it's in deference to the
Captain that I brought you here? 
SPOCK: Affirmative. 
TRELANE: I don't know if I like your tone. It's most challenging.
That's what you're doing, challenging me? 
SPOCK: I object to you. I object to intellect without discipline. I
object to power without constructive purpose. 
TRELANE: Oh, Mister Spock, you do have one saving grace after all.
You're ill-mannered. The human half of you, no doubt. (to Ross) Ah,
come, my little wood nymph. Won't you dance with your swain? (to Uhura)
Give us some sprightly music, my dear girl. 
UHURA: I don't know how to play this. 
TRELANE: Of course you do. 
(And she does, as Trelane dances with Ross) 
SULU: Captain, how far do we go along with this charade? 
KIRK: Until we can think our way out. Meanwhile, we accept his
hospitality. 
MCCOY: You should taste his food. Straw would taste better than his
meat, and water a hundred times better than his brandy. Nothing has any
taste at all. 
SPOCK: It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical. 
MCCOY: There's that magic word again. Does your logic find this
fascinating, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Fascinating is a word I use for the unexpected. In this case, I
should think interesting would suffice. 
KIRK: You don't find this unexpected, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: That his food has no taste, his wine no flavour? No. It simply
means that Trelane knows all of the Earth forms, but none of the
substance. 
KIRK: And if he's fallible, he can't be all powerful. Which means he
has something helping him. 
SPOCK: Evidently. 
KIRK: A machine? A device? Something which does these things for him. 
TRELANE: Ah, my dear, don't we make a graceful pair? Except for one
small detail. That dress hardly matches this charming scene. 
(Suddenly she's wearing an empire line dress with feathers in her hair.
Idealised Jane Austen) 
TRELANE: Ah, yes, that's more what we want. The dashing warrior and his
elegant lady. 
KIRK: That mirror. It's part of his audience, his ego. He never wanders
from it. 
SPOCK: Is it ego, or something else? 
KIRK: Explain. 
SPOCK: The mirror. 
KIRK: What about it? 
SPOCK: You noted yourself he never gets very far from it. I suppose it
could be vanity. 
KIRK: No, no, Mister Spock, that's not the reason. What kind of a
machine could do these things? 
SPOCK: A machine with the ability to turn energy into matter guided by
thought waves. It would have a very complex memory bank, and would be
extremely sophisticated. 
KIRK; Like a computer, only much more. Could the machine that maintains
the environment in this immediate area be kept in this house? 
SPOCK: I think not. A device capable of keeping out this planet's
natural atmosphere would be immense. 
KIRK: Good. I agree. That leaves me free 
.
SPOCK: Free, Captain? 
KIRK: If I'm not mistaken, Mister Spock, I think I can turn his lights
off at the source. (raises his voice) Don't be too upset by what you
see, gentlemen. After all, his actions are those of an immature,
unbalanced mind. 
TRELANE: I overheard that remark, Captain. I'm afraid I'll have to
dispense with you. 
KIRK: You only heard part of it. I just started. 
TRELANE: Oh? 
KIRK: Yes. I want you to leave my crewmen alone. I want you to leave my
crewwomen alone too. (to Ross) You're not to dance with him. I don't
like it. 
TRELANE: Does it actually make you angry, Captain? 
KIRK: (removing one of her long gloves) I don't want you accepting his
gifts, either. 
ROSS: Captain, please don't do this. 
TRELANE: Well, I do believe the dear Captain is jealous of me. 
KIRK: I don't care what you believe, just keep your hands off her! 
TRELANE: Oh, how curiously human. How wonderfully barbaric. 
KIRK: I've had enough of your insulting attentions to her. 
TRELANE: Of course you have. After all, that's the root of the matter,
isn't it? You fight for the attention, the admiration, the possession
of women. 
KIRK: If it's fighting that you want, (slaps Trelane) you may have it. 
TRELANE: Are you challenging me to a duel? 
KIRK: If you have the courage. 
TRELANE: Oh, this is better than I'd planned. I shall not shirk an
affair of honour. 
(He gets a box from the mantle-shelf. It contains a pair of duelling
pistols) 
TRELANE: A matched set. Just like the pair that slew your heroic
Alexander Hamilton. And Captain, I never miss.
Captain's Log, stardate 2126.1. Delayed report. The
whole bridge crew are the unwilling guests of the creature who calls
himself Trelane. We are weaponless, powerless, and our only hope of
escape with the Enterprise lies in playing his games. I've decided to
make my move with the field of honour game, and everything depends on
my one chance with the ancient duelling pistol.
[Drawing room]
TRELANE: Oh, how fascinating. I'm party to an
actual human duel. 
KIRK: Are you ready? 
TRELANE: Quite ready, sir. We shall test each other's courage and then,
and then we shall see. 
KIRK: Enough talk. Let's get on with it. 
TRELANE: As you will, sir. Honour will be served, eh? Oh, wait! As the
one challenged, I claim the first shot. 
KIRK: We shoot together. 
TRELANE: It's my game and my rules, but if you need to be persuaded.
(aims at Spock) 
KIRK: All right. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
(Trelane takes aim, then fires his pistol at the ceiling instead)
